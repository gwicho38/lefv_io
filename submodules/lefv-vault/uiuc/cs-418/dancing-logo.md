# DANCING LOGO

## EXAMPLE

Sure, here is a solution to the question:

```python
import math
import random

def rasterize_bitmap(filename, width, height):
  """Rasterizes a bitmap from a file into a width x height
  array.

  Args:
    filename: The filename of the bitmap file.
    width, height: The width and height of the bitmap.

  Returns:
    A list of lists representing the pixels in the bitmap.
  """

  pixels = []
  with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    reader = png.Reader(f)
    width, height, bit_depth, _ = reader.read_header()
    if bit_depth == 8:
      pixels = [
          [int(pixel) for pixel in row]
          for row in reader.read_image().astype("uint8").reshape(height, width)
      ]
    elif bit_depth == 16:
      pixels = [
          [int(pixel) for pixel in row]
          for row in reader.read_image().astype("uint16").reshape(height, width)
      ]
  return pixels

def main():
  width, height = 100, 100
  pixels = rasterize_bitmap("uiuc.png", width, height)
  for row in pixels:
    for pixel in row:
      print(pixel, end=" ")
    print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

This program first defines a function called `rasterize_bitmap()` that takes the filename of a bitmap file, as well as the width and height of the bitmap, and returns a list of lists representing the pixels in the bitmap. The function works by first reading the bitmap file and then converting the pixels to a list of lists.

The main function of the program then takes the width and height of the bitmap as input, and calls the `rasterize_bitmap()` function to rasterize the bitmap file `uiuc.png`. The list of pixels in the bitmap is then printed to the console.

To run the program, you can save it as a Python script and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the program as `rasterize_bitmap.py`, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

```
python rasterize_bitmap.py
```

This will print the list of pixels in the bitmap to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
