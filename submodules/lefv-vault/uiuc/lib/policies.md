# University Campus Policies, Student Code, and Academic Integrity

# Campus Policies

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ("University") is committed to providing a safe and welcoming campus environment free from discrimination based on sex, which includes sexual assault, sexual exploitation, stalking, sexual harassment, dating violence, and domestic violence (collectively referred to as sexual misconduct). See [Campus Policies and Procedures](http://wecare.illinois.edu/policies/campus/) for more information.

# Student Code

A student at the University of Illinois at the Urbana‑Champaign campus is a member of a University community of which all members have at least the rights and responsibilities common to all citizens, free from institutional censorship; affiliation with the University as a student does not diminish the rights or responsibilities held by a student or any other community member as a citizen of larger communities of the state, the nation, and the world. See the [University of Illinois Student Code](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/index.html) for more information.

# Academic Integrity

It is the responsibility of each student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions. Students have been given notice of this Part by virtue of its publication. Regardless of whether a student has actually read this Part, a student is charged with knowledge of it. Ignorance is not a defense. For more information about academic integrity, see [Article 1 – Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/) or visit the [Students' Quick Reference Guide to Academic Integrity](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/).

Academic integrity violations may result in dismissal from the University.

# Academic Standing

A minimum 3.0 grade point average (GPA), corresponding to a grade of B, must be maintained to stay in all graduate programs and to graduate. Please review Article 3—academic policies and regulations, sections [3-102](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article3/part1/3-102/), [3-103,](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article3/part1/3-103/) and [3-104](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article3/part1/3-104/), of the Student Code.

The graduate GPA includes all hours and grades for all courses taken while enrolled as a graduate student. The GPA component of academic status is calculated at the end of each semester. At the point of calculation, graduate students must have a cumulative graduate GPA at or above a 3.0 and a semester GPA of at least 2.75 to be in good standing.

A [GPA calculator](https://secure.registrar.illinois.edu/GPACalculator/test.aspx) is available at the Office of the Registrar.

# Title IX

Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that upholds Title IX policy; this includes communication using such tools as Slack and Piazza. All students are required to complete Title IX training. **Failure to complete training will prevent students from registering for future semesters.** Please see the Title IX [website](https://wecare.illinois.edu/titleix/) for more information.
