Hello, and welcome back to Theory and
Practice of Data Cleaning.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,580
In previous lectures we looked
at individual pieces of a larger

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,470
data cleaning lifecycle.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,000
We started with syntax-based
data transformation and

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,530
cleaning using regular expressions and
then using open refine.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,450
We then moved on to data integrity
checking at the schema or

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,120
semantic level where we can look
not only at individual columns but

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,440
at complex relations and data tables
as a whole and their interconnections.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,430
In the following lectures,
we take a step back and

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,280
look at the data life cycle again.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,640
When researchers and
data scientists analyzed their data,

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,580
they often need to
automate multiple steps.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,640
Automation can happen even for
the data cleaning itself.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,290
But certainly for complex computational
analysis, you want to use a workflow

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,890
system, or script-based approach, say
Python or R, to automate your analysis.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,070
So the following lectures will
introduce basic notions of workflows,

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,740
focusing in particular and
scientific workflow automation.

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,160
Another aspect that is related
to automation is providence.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,430
That is the origin and processing history
of data that comes out of the workflow.

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,370
This will be the topic of future lectures.

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,873
Okay, let's jump right into
the first lecture on workflows.
