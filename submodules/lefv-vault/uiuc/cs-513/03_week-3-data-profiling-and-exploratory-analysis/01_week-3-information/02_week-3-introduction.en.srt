00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:11,770
Hello and welcome back to Theory and
Practice of Data Cleaning.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,290
Last week, we learned about our first
hands-on tool, regular expressions,

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,000
which we can use to check whether
data matches a certain pattern, or

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,670
conforms to a certain standard.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,538
Regular expressions can also
be used in a power tool for

7
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:27,410
data cleaning that we are studying
this week OpenRefine.

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,400
In this week, we will talk about how
to normalize data, it is eliminates and

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,980
tactic differences in data such as
different spellings of names, places or

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,600
other entities.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,510
Other differences for example, the use of
upper case or lower case letters Or mixed

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,860
forms of these, or the use of additional
white spaces, punctuation symbols and so

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,510
on can all be nicely addressed and
cleaned up with OpenRefine.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,160
Specifically, we will learn about
common transformations in OpenRefine,

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,070
facets and clustering.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,000
By collecting the different or
similar values in a cluster,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,060
a single canonical name can be selected
to represent the single entity that

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,980
is referred to by the slightly different
spellings and syntactic variances.

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,210
The goal of this week is to enable you
to create a new OpenRefine project, and

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,430
load tabular data into the system.

21
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,700
After which, you can then apply
common syntactic transformations,

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,370
such as trimming white spaces.

23
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,590
And finally, you should be able
to use facets at clustering.

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,980
The letter is a particular strength of
OpenRefine that let's you normalize

25
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,420
different variations and
bring them into canonical form

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,870
which is really a prerequisite for
most subsequent data analysis projects.

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,300
When you master OpenRefine,
even at the beginners level, you will have

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,030
a power tool at your disposal that can
help you get your data cleaning job done.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,740
At the end of this week, you will again
be able to test what you've learned

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,030
using your hands on
assignment using OpenRefine.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,165
All right, so much for now and
let's go to the first lecture.

00:01:50,165 --> 00:02:00,165
