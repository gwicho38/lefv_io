2
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:12,690
Welcome back, now let's wrap up
what we've learned from this week.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,000
This week, we encountered a powerful
open source data cleaning tool

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,760
called OpenRefine.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,570
I demonstrated OpenRefine by exploring its
use with two publicly available data sets,

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,700
that is the National Farmer's Market
Database from the US Department of

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,060
Agriculture and a crowd sourced collection

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,190
of historical restaurant menus provided
by the New York Public Library.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,430
We walk through some basic functions and
transformations of OpenRefine and I also

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,020
showed some advanced features relating to
clustering and normalization of names.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,940
As you have seen, OpenRefine is also
fairly easy to install and once installed,

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,580
can be used from a web browser.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,650
By working with the materials
from this week and

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,890
practicing your OpenRefine skills,
as part of the assignment, you should

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,250
now be ready to create an OpenRefine
project, import and profile data, and

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,789
apply common transformations and other
mass edits to clean individual columns.

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,710
In particular you should be able to use
clustering based methods to normalize data

18
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,420
and bring difference and
tactic variance into economic performance.

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,658
You should also be able to document
the changes made to the data using

20
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:14,141
OpenRefine's operation history.

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,260
This is a form of data providence
that we shall encounter again

22
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,389
in more detail towards
the end of this course.

23
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,060
OpenRefine is an open source power tool
that started out as Google refine.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,480
This is fairly well known in the library
and information science community, and

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,790
can be applied for many data cleaning
tasks of moderately size data collection.

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,860
The ideas and techniques presented
to you can also be applied for

27
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,460
using in other systems.

28
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,720
Since data cleaning is of
great practical importance,

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,260
you will probably see more tools like
OpenRefine emerging in the market.

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,400
In fact, there are already startup
companies out there developing commercial

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,980
products with enhanced and

32
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,690
more scalable features similar to
those we encountered in OpenRefine.

33
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,420
Next week, we will move on from data
cleaning operations on individual columns.

34
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,541
And we look at logical constraints
between multiple columns and data tables.

35
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,854
We will work with
the relational data model.

36
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:14,854
