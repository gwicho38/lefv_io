  Week 5: Datalog and Integrity Constraints
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  Simple validation and transformation techniques can be used to address syntactic errors in data, but are not able to address logical errors. For example, they can be used to validate and normalize ZIP code and state abbreviations, but not determine whether the ZIP code/state combination is valid. Logic errors can be identified through the definition of data quality rules in the form of integrity constraints such as functional and inclusion dependencies. Integrity constraints are expressed as logic rules or queries.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this module we introduce Datalog, a rule-based language for expressing relational queries and integrity constraints. Integrity constraints can be defined and checked with Datalog thus complementing the pattern-based data cleaning in OpenRefine with logic-based data quality checks. We begin with Datalog, because it makes clear the underlying logical kernel of queries and integrity constraints that is sometimes obscured in languages such as SQL.
