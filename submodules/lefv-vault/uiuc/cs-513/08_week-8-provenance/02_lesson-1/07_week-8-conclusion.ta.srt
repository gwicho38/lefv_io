00:00:09,324 --> 00:00:10,824
In this week's lectures,

3
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:14,080
we have seen that workflows and provenance are closely related.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,460
Workflows can be seen as a special form of prospective provenance that describes

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,800
data flow and data dependencies of

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,010
data products in terms of inputs and intermediate steps.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,500
Retrospective provenance can be understood as

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,304
traditional trace or logging information where

9
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:34,700
runtime observables are captured that document the data processing history and lineage.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,140
In the upcoming videos, we will take a closer look at a particular tool for modeling,

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,780
visualizing, and querying provenance from script-based workflows.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,039
That is, we will be working with the YesWorkflow tool.
