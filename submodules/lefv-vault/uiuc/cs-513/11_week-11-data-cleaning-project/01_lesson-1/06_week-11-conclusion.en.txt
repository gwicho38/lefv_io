[MUSIC] In this last set of lectures,
we have ventured into research land and looked at new ways to align and
merge control vocabularies or taxonomies using a logic based approach. You've seen how the Euler X research
prototype can be used to align and merge different taxonomies. In these final weeks of the course,
you will also work on your end to end data cleaning project and combine various tools
and techniques you learned about here. Specifically, open refine,
escale lite, and yes work flow. Good luck with your final project and
until next time. [MUSIC]
