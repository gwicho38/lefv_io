00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,914
Welcome back. In this week's lectures,

2
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:13,210
we have seen different aspects of workflow modeling and

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,204
provenance coming together when using the YesWorkflow toolkit.

4
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:19,179
YesWorkflow can be used to model, render,

5
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:23,359
and even query both prospective and retrospective provenance information.

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,815
While in the beginning of this course,

7
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:28,480
we started out with different aspects and dimensions of data quality,

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,292
focusing on ways to check and improve syntactic and semantic data quality,

9
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:35,094
we have now come full circle.

10
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:40,119
We have seen how workflow techniques can be used not only to automate repetitive tasks,

11
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:42,835
say we have workflow systems or conventional scripts,

12
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,710
but also how basic notions,

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,039
such as provenance, and tools that support modeling,

14
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,049
capture, and querying of provenance can be used to improve transparency of data analysis.

15
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:57,070
Ultimately, the use of provenance techniques and tools such as YesWorkflow contribute to

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,945
the transparency and reproducibility of data wrangling and analysis pipelines,

17
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:06,599
and thus help that newly generated data is of good or at least known quality.

18
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,715
But no matter what the quality is of the data you are working with,

19
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:12,224
we hope that some of the tools and techniques you've learned about in

20
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:15,834
this course will help you in tackling your next data wrangling job.

21
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:19,750
And while an increasing number of ever more powerful tools is becoming available,

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,989
many of the underlying principles such as pattern-based cleaning,

23
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,844
integrity constraints and queries,

24
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,709
or workflows and provenance will be

25
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:30,819
useful no matter what specific tools you will be adopting.
