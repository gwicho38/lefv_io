2
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:11,477
Welcome back, now let's wrap up what
we have learned about SQL queries and

3
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:13,050
integrity constraints this week.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,591
Now overall data cleaning life cycle
we have moved from this enthectic and

5
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:21,110
pedal level data cleaning through
the logical or semantic level.

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,600
First using data log as our main language.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,685
In this week, we have done a recap or

8
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:28,962
crush course depending on
your prior knowledge on SQL.

9
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:33,528
We have seen how to formulate general
queries in SQL as well as written special

10
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:36,490
queries for
identifying integrity violations.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,930
This is also the subject
of the assignment.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,428
In future lectures we will then zoom out
and look at the larger data cleaning and

13
00:00:43,428 --> 00:00:44,441
analysis workflows.
