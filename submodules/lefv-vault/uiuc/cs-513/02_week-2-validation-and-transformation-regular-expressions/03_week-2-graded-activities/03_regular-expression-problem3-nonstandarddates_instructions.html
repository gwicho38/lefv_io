    You have to write three regexes (Parts a, b, and c), each worth 12.5 points, so this problem is worth 37.5 points total (37 on Coursera).

  Regex to Match Non-Standard Dates
 </h1>
 <p>
  In the US, dates are often written in the form
  <strong>
   MM/DD/YYYY
  </strong>
  , e.g.,
  <strong>
   02/14/2017
  </strong>
  .  Another common variant is: February 14, 2017. In some European  countries it is common to write this date as 14.2.2017 or 14.02.2017.  Develop regular expressions that match the following non-ISO conformant  (but widespread) ways to write dates:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Note that you do not have to verify that the date actually exists, e.g. February 30, 2017 is OK for this exercise.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Develop regular expressions that match the following formats:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    (a)
    <strong>
     02/14/2017
    </strong>
    (and dates like it, i.e. of the  form Month/Day/Year). Note that leading zeros may be omitted (e.g.,  2/14/2017 should be matched as well).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    (b)
    <strong>
     14.02.2017
    </strong>
    (and similar, i.e., of the form Day.Month.Year). Again, there may or may not be leading zeros (e.g., 14.2.2017 is allowed).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    (c)
    <strong>
     February 14, 2017
    </strong>
    (and similar). Here the regex should allow only correct spellings of the months January through December, but
    <strong>
     independent of case
    </strong>
    :  (e.g., FEBRUARY in uppercase or february are OK, but FEBRUAR (missing “  Y”) is not OK). Hint: find a way to make regex matching
    <strong>
     case insensitive
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Treat all months
  <strong>
   as if they have 31 days
  </strong>
  . You do not  have to differentiate 28, 29, 30, 31 days of different months!  Similarly, you do not need to consider leap years in any of the  questions.
