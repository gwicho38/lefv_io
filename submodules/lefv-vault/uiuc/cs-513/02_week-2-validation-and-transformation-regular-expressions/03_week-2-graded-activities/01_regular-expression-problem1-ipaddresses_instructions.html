  About Test Cases and Grading
 </h1>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    You have to write two regexes (Part a, Part b), each worth 12.5 points, so this problem is worth 25 points total.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Each regex will be checked against 10 test cases for correctness (each test case is worth 1.25 points).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Note that we test your regular expressions against positive and  negative examples, i.e., we check that your regex is indeed matching the  positive examples, but that it is not matching the negative examples.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    To check whether you're on the right path, we provide two positive  and two negative test cases. (You can also make up more test cases of  your own.) The four test cases are worth 1.25 * 4 = 5 points.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    After submission, we  run each of your regexes against three  positive and three negative examples. Together these six test cases are  worth 1.25 * 6 = 7.5 points. Thus the total points for each regex part  is 5 + 7.5 = 12.5 points.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  You need to write regexes as Python raw strings, and we will use Python as the regex engine.

  Regex to match IP Addresses
 </h1>
 <p>
  An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a sequence of 4 numbers (between 0 and 255), using a single dot ‘.’ as a separator: e.g.,
  <strong>
   172.16.254.1
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   127.0.0.1
  </strong>
  are valid IPs (more precisely IPv4) addresses. You need to write two regular expressions to match IP addresses:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    (a) A regular expression that matches IP addresses. Here you do
    <strong>
     not
    </strong>
    have to check that the numbers are in the range of 0 to 255. Try to keep it simple!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    (b) Now develop a more precise regex that also makes sure that examples such as
    <strong>
     302.207.451.22
    </strong>
    are
    <strong>
     not matched
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
