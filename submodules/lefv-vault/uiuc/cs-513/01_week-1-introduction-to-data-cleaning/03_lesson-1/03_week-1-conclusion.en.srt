00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:09,800
Welcome back.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,010
Now, let's briefly summarize some key
notions we learned about this week.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,530
We learned that the data quality is
usually defined as fitness for use.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,510
The intended use, specifically,
what questions you may want to

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,290
answer with your data, determines
whether your data is clean enough, or

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,130
of high enough quality,
for the intended purpose.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,020
We learned about a few key
data quality dimensions, and

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,550
in the optional readings posted for

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,745
this week, you can drill deeper into many
other aspects of data quality dimensions.

11
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:40,555
You also saw that we can structure
the overall themes of this course into

12
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:44,555
syntax and pattern based cleaning,
then, schema and semantics for

13
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:46,985
which we will use
a language called Datalog.

14
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:49,075
And synthesis, where we zoom out again and

15
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:52,205
look at the larger workflow of
which data cleaning is a part.

16
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:56,091
Related to the latter is the notion of
prominence or data lineage and processing

17
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:59,924
history, something that will turn our
attention to at the end of this course.

18
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:01,519
In week two,

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,880
we will learn about an important formulas
and tool called regular expressions.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,380
Regular expressions allow us to
check whether the syntactic patterns

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,650
we find in data match
certain standard formats, or

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,730
whether they require
additional processing.

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,790
We will practice matching with regular
expressions in our first hands-on

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,700
assignment next week.

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,279
Regular expressions are also part of
the powerful OpenRefine tool that we will

26
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:25,705
work with in week three.
