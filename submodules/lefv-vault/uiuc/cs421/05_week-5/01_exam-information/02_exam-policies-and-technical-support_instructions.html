  Exam Policies
 </h2>
 <p>
  The following polices will be enforced while taking the exam:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    The exam will be proctored via ProctorU.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The exam is timed for
    <strong>
     2 hours
    </strong>
    under ProctorU's supervision.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The exam only allows
    <strong>
     1 attempt
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Make sure you sign up for an account via ProctorU. To sign up for an account, please go to:
    <a href="https://go.proctoru.com/students/users/new?institution=12" title="">
     https://go.proctoru.com/students/users/new?institution=12
    </a>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    You need to schedule the exam
    <strong>
     72 hours prior to the exam start window
    </strong>
    . After that, you must schedule by phone with an additional premium rush fee.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Proctored exams require stable internet connection, webcam, and microphone. It is
    <strong>
     strongly recommended
    </strong>
    that you pass the
    <a href="https://www.proctoru.com/testitout/" title="">
     ProctorU System Test
    </a>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Please ensure you are connected to an Internet connection for the entire duration of exam. Otherwise, you will have to go through a lot of red tape.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If you are disconnected from the proctor during the exam for
    <strong>
     more than 5 minutes
    </strong>
    , you must reschedule the exam with ProctorU (for free) in a timely fashion within the exam two-day window. So it is highly recommended that you pass the ProctorU System Test before you take the exam. An incident reported will be generated and sent to your instructor if you disconnect from the proctor for over 5 minutes.
