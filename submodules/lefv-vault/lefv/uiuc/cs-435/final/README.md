### Instructor Comments / FAQ

#### Papers as Test Reference?

```
The final will cover lecture, quiz, and programming assignment material.

The lectures and quizzes include some material from research papers.  So, you can view the corresponding papers like the textbook that's backing the lecture & quiz materials.  For example, portions of the "Scalable, Commodity Data Center Network Architecture" paper in week 11, and the VL2 and Network Virtualization papers in week 12 can be helpful.  (This is not a complete list.)

However, what I'd say is that the material from the papers included in the final is mentioned in the lectures or quizzes.  So you could study by using the lectures as a guide and referring to certain sections of the papers when they are relevant.

The final won't have questions on portions of the papers that were never referenced in lectures or quizzes.
