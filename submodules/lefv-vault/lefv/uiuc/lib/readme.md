## Proctored Exam

# What is ProctorU?

## What is ProctorU?

ProctorU is a proctoring service that allows students to complete their exams from nearly any location while still ensuring the academic integrity of the exam for the institution. Using almost any webcam and computer, students connect to real people who help enter the exam and monitor real time as they complete it. Proctors act as the student's personal exam concierge, helping them with technical difficulties and making sure they understand the rules of the exam.

**Online MCS/MCS-DS students are responsible for the proctoring fee.**

## How to Schedule the Proctored Exam

1.  If this is your first time scheduling an exam with ProctorU, click on the **Sign Up** link on the [University of Illinois ProctorU portal page](http://proctoru.com/portal/illinois) to create a new user account and ProctorU log-in password. **_Students must use the University of Illinois email address to register for the account._**

4.  You should navigate to the password quiz in the course site and open the password quiz for the proctor.
    
5.  Proctor will type in the password in the password quiz for you. Under no circumstances should you type in a password. **Please turn your head around when the proctor enters the password**.
    
6.  You can submit the password quiz after the proctor enters the password.
    
7.  Once the password is accepted, you can start the proctored exam under the proctor's supervision.

## **Content and Etiquette**

Reference: [Coursera Code of Conduct](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280036)

**Be polite.**

-   Treat your fellow learners with respect.
    
-   Insulting, condescending, or abusive words will not be tolerated.
    
-   Do not harass other learners.
    
-   Polite debate is welcome as long as you are discussing the ideas, not attacking the person.
    
-   “SHOUTING” online should be avoided. Using all caps online is known as shouting and is a rude method of communicating. Use caps for specific purposes.
    

**Be sensitive.**

-   Remember that there are learners from many different cultures and backgrounds.
    
-   Be kind, thoughtful, and open-minded when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others likely have differing perspectives.
    

**Post appropriate content.**

-   You may not post inappropriate (e.g., pornographic or obscene) content.
    
-   Do not post copyrighted content.
    
-   Do not advertise or promote outside products or organizations.
    

**Frequency**

Do not send individuals or group messages repetitively. If you need to reach a student about an important issue and have not received any response, please send an email to **mcs-support@illinois.edu** and Program Staff can intervene.

# Discussion Forums

Discussion forums provide a space for you to interact, share resources, and help one another with questions about the course materials and assignments. With its asynchronous nature of forums, instructors often provide question prompts for you to digest the content learned from your course and apply it to other scenarios. It also provides a great opportunity to see different perspectives from others.

Discussion forums used in the program are Campuswire or Piazza. 

**Campuswire** is a FERPA compliant discussion board and communication tool for courses. It is an alternative to Piazza. Students must be invited to Campuswire with their @illinois.edu email address. 

Campuswire Demo: [https://www.loom.com/share/eeae3c81396043b886b569709a024000](https://www.loom.com/share/eeae3c81396043b886b569709a024000)

**Piazza** is another discussion forum sometimes used in courses. See [Piazza intro for students](https://youtu.be/tqGummy1Be4?list=PLEOX0FOixqJ4gJEWOelsBJBQ1mD05ZUKC).

## Subscription to Discussion Forums Class

Participation in class forums is restricted to students currently enrolled in each class. Students should receive an invite link via email.

If a student un-enrolls from a class, they must unsubscribe from the associated forums. If assistance is needed to unsubscribe, please contact [mcs-support@illinois.edu](mailto:mcs-support@illinois.edu).
