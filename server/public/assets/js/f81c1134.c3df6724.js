It proceeds by\\ndescribing and analyzing the incident within the adversary, capability,\\ninfrastructure, and victim Diamond Model framework. \\n\\nThe post then examines the Diamond Model\'s social-political and technological \\"meta\\nfeatures\\" to contextualize the incident. Finally, this post concludes\\nby arguing that the problem of politically motivated cyber-attacks\\ncarried out by an Advance Persistessnt Threat (APT) is best addressed at\\nthe international level.\\n\\n# FireEye Incident\\n\\nFireEye reported that it was attacked by \\"foreign government hackers\\" on\\nDecember 8, 2020 through a press release. The release detailed FireEye\'s\\nassessment that the hack was perpetrated by a \\"government-sponsored\\"\\nhacking group seeking \\"information related to \\\\[FireEye\\\\] government\\ncustomers.\\" \\\\[1\\\\] Of note, FireEye reported that its proprietary \\"red\\nteam tools\\" were stolen. \\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\n# Diamond Model Applied to FireEye Incident\\n\\n## Adversary\\n\\nFireEye claims that the adversary was part of a \\"nation-state\\ncyber-espionage effort.\\" \\\\[2\\\\] There has not been an official report\\nattributing the adversary operator or customer. Unofficial analyses note\\nthat the attack is part of a protracted virtual conflict between Russia\\nand Western powers.\\n\\nOne analysist asserts that the \\"Cozy Bear/APT29\\" hacking group was the\\nprimary operator (with Russia being the Adversary Customer). \\\\[3\\\\] It\\nnoted that \\"indications continue to implicate the SVR, the Russian\\nForeign Intelligence Service, which serves as Russia\'s intelligence and\\nglobal espionage organization and is frequently referred to as Cozy Bear\\nor APT29.\\" \\\\[3\\\\] Additionally, FireEye\'s attack appeared to leverage\\nsimilar techniques to those used in the SolarWinds incident earlier in\\n2020 (which has already been officially attributed to Russia). \\\\[4\\\\]\\n\\nThe intent of the adversary can also be imputed as being like that of\\nthe SolarWinds incident: serve Vladimir Putin\'s domestic and foreign\\npolitical ambitions while stealing security assessment tools that could\\nhelp the Russians prepare for future cyber-attacks.\\n\\n## Capability\\n\\nAPT29\'s capability is vast (as is the adversary principal\'s arsenal).\\nThe capability employed by APT29 seems to depend on the faction(s) of\\nthe hacker-group that carries out the attack. \\\\[5\\\\] It is thought to\\noperate through multiple drop points and low activity, use spear\\nphishing emails with self-extracting archive attachments, use Windows\\nLNK files, the Cobalt Strike rootkit, and use custom malware (known by\\nWellMess and WellMail) to target international organizations. \\\\[6\\\\]\\nAdditionally, APT29\'s attacks have been reported to operate with a\\ntoolset that shares many \\"functional\\" and \\"structural\\" linkages to the\\nMiniDuke, CosmicDuke, and OnionDuke malware components. These linkages\\ninclude UAC bypass, Registry Run keys, encoded PowerShell scripts,\\nself-signed certificates, and SDelete. \\\\[7\\\\] APT29\'s C2 infrastructure\\nis known to use redundancy paths that can use Twitter to look for\\nspecific tweets from pre-made accounts with specific tags labeling\\nencrypted URLs to backdoors. \\\\[7\\\\] Finally, by exfiltrating FireEye\'s\\n\\"red-team\\" tools the adversaries have been able scale up their\\nindividual capacity with little additional investment.\\n\\n## Infrastructure\\n\\nAPT29 has steadily grown its C2 infrastructure (originally by\\ncompromising websites that would install payload malware). \\\\[8\\\\] APT29\'s\\ninfrastructure has been particularly studied vis-\xe0-vis the HAMMERTOSS\\nmalware identified by FireEye in 2015. \\\\[9\\\\]\\n\\nFirst, APT29 leverages Type 2 infrastructure to build HAMMERTOSS\'s\\ninstruction set and begin the data exfiltration. Once installed on an\\ninfected machine, HAMMERTOSS typically builds and leverages its\\ninfrastructure through a bifurcated process that calls out to its C2\\nserver directly (Uploader) or through an intermediary (tDiscoverer).\\nAPT29 appears to regularly use the tDiscoverer path. The tDiscoverer\\npath uses Twitter as an intermediate obfuscation layer before calling\\nout to the Uploader domain. \\\\[9\\\\]\\n\\nTo generate the C2 Twitter URL, HAMMERTOSS will create a Twitter handle\\nbuilt on a time-based string concatenation algorithm. This algorithm is\\nshared between the C2 host and the victim malware. The infected PC will\\nthen then continue to call out to the generated handle daily until the\\nC2 attacker chooses to register the shared handle on a particular day.\\nIf the C2 URL was registered by the attacker, the attacker will then\\ninclude instructions (composed of a URL and a hash tag) pointing the\\nmalware to seemingly innocuous content hosted on Github. Finally, the\\nimage downloaded from Github will encode specific instructions directing\\nthe victim to a cloud-storage server that is pre-configured by the\\nattackers as well executed by way of a Windows command shell script.\\n\\nSecond, APT29 depends on Service Providers to carry almost all\\ninstructions and data to and from the victim PC. HAMMERTOSS depends on\\nthe uniformity and predictability of the TCP/IP stack, leveraging ISPs\\nand domain registrars to provide reliable routing of their malicious\\ninstructions. Further, CISA has cautioned that APT29 has specifically\\nused \\"Kerberoasting\\" to attack Microsoft Active Directory and compromise\\nWindows domain controllers. \\\\[10\\\\]\\n\\n## Victim\\n\\nThe victim of the incident was FireEye. FireEye provides\\nintelligence-based cybersecurity prevention, investigation, response,\\nand remediation services. FireEye is particularly known for its work\\nuncovering state-sponsored hacking groups. \\\\[10\\\\] For example, it was\\ncredited with identifying Russian military hacks against Ukraine\'s\\nenergy grid in 2016. \\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\nThe \\"*victim persona*\\" was FireEye in its role as a cybersecurity\\nprovider. FireEye\'s CEO, Kevin Mandia, unequivocally concluded that the\\nattackers \\"tailored their capabilities to target and attack FireEye.\\"\\n\\\\[2\\\\] Additionally, FireEye noted the sophistication and novelty of the\\ntechniques used to remain undiscovered and exfiltrate the targeted data\\nevinced a purposeful intent. \\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\nThe \\"*victim asset*\\" is a mixed bag. The primary asset sought was\\nreported by FireEye as being \\"information related to certain government\\ncustomers.\\" \\\\[2\\\\] The desire to leverage government contractors as an\\nancillary method of obtaining government data has many precedents, and\\nimportantly, the end goal is evident -- using the information to attack\\nthe Federal and State governments of the United States. A clear instance\\nof this was the SolarWinds Orion Security Breach, a.k.a. SUNBURST where\\nvarious much of the US Federal government was hacked by APT29.\\n\\nHowever, APT29 is clearly opportunistic. In exfiltrating FireEye\'s\\nred-team tools, the group has shown an openness to redefine the assets\\nsought on an *ad hoc* nature. This willingness to improvise on the\\nassets collected suggests that APT29 wants its capabilities to be known,\\nhighlighted, and grown.\\n\\n## Event Meta Features\\n\\n## *Social-Political Meta Features?*\\n\\nFireEye provided APT29 with an enviable array of products sought by\\npolitically motivated APTs: its client-base records and its red-team\\ntools/methodologies. First, FireEye\'s core business focuses on\\n\\"appliance-based detection and prevention of stealthy and targeted\\ncyber-attacks.\\" \\\\[12\\\\] In its public filings, FireEye marketed itself on\\nits \\"relationships with governments around the globe, both as a\\ncybersecurity solutions provider and a trusted advisor.\\" \\\\[12\\\\]\\nPractically speaking, intelligence gathering operations in any country\\ncould \\"short-circuit\\" much of their intelligence-gathering process by\\nobtaining key-contacts through FireEye. Of even more note, the\\nSolarWinds SUNBURST incident earlier in the year was purportedly\\nfacilitated by targeting government IT employees that were known (or\\npresumed) to have highly privileged accounts. It is likely that\\nsimilarly situated individuals would have been responsible for managing\\nthe relationship with FireEye and were therefore attractive products for\\nAPT29\'s consumption.\\n\\nSecond, FireEye also provided APT29 with an ancillary product that could\\nscale APT29\'s operations at an even greater pace than seen thus far --\\nits \\"red team\\" tools. While FireEye has reported that none of their\\ntools \\"contain zero-day exploits,\\" these very tools provide APT29 with\\nfirst-hand knowledge of the testing tools used in testing American cyber\\ndefenses. \\\\[13\\\\] In consuming FireEye\'s red team tools, APT29 can\\ntherefore fulfill a two-fold need: (i) gaining insight into key\\ncounter-defense information to better tailor future attacks, and (ii)\\npotentially raising funds by selling such tools to third parties.\\n\\nFinally, APT29\'s demand for politically connected targets suggest that\\nits relationship with FireEye is likely to be more than fleeting.\\nFireEye is a market leader in cybersecurity services, establishing it as\\na steady producer of future government contacts. While the effort\\nexpended by APT29 to maintain operations against sophisticated actors\\nsuch as FireEye may be great, resource/time constraints appear to be\\nslim given the social-political posture of Russia.\\n\\n## *Technology Meta Features?*\\n\\nAPT29\'s demonstrated technological capability is vast. With the full\\nbacking of the Russian government assumed, the group has demonstrated an\\nability to use social engineering techniques to perform sophisticated\\nspear-phishing campaigns, as well as build obfuscated redundancies into\\ntheir C2 infrastructure. Additionally, the structure of APT29\'s attacks\\nrely on the canonical TCP/IP stack, and is often structured to mimic\\nactions of legitimate users (e.g., HAMMERTOSS calling out to Twitter\\nonly once per day). Finally, APT29 is known to target the very trust\\nframeworks that buttress the Internet. For example, the SolarWinds\\nSUNBURST attack spoofed Active Directory Federation Services token\\nsigning certificates (referred to as the \\"Golden SAML\\" attack). \\\\[14\\\\]\\nIn sum, APT29 represents an example of the pinnacle of sophisticated\\nthreat actors whose actions known and leverage virtually all techniques\\nand architectures built into our current networking infrastructure. Such\\nsophistication highlights the wisdom of defense-in-depth strategies as\\nbest practice.\\n\\n## Diamond Model Diagram\\n\\n\\n# Policy Assessment to FireEye Incident\\n\\n> The problem raised by the FireEye incident is how best to address\\n> politically motivated cyber-attacks carried out by APTs.
