2
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:10,890
All right, let's have a look
how we install OpenRefine.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,140
So first we go to openrefine.org and
go to the Download page.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:21,180
And I'm here on a Mac, so I will try and
find the Mac kit for OpenRefine.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,500
So I can use actually here
the Release Candidate 2 that sounds like

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,820
the most recent reasonably stable version.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,360
So that's what I'm going to use.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,670
I'm going to click on Mac kit, and

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,470
it starts downloading here
about a hundred megabytes.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,060
So we're on a fairly fast connection,
and once this is downloaded,

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,990
I can select this and
start the installation.

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,263
So I double-click on this,
and we now see OpenRefine

13
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:56,080
has been made available to us for
installation.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,900
In this case, on the Mac, I'll just drag
it over here to the applications folder.

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,422
It notices that there's already another
item there because I installed OpenRefine

16
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:09,188
previously, so I'm going to say,
I'm going to be brave and say Replace.

17
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:15,320
And now,
I should have OpenRefine available.

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,630
So where is it?

19
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,464
This was from the download.

20
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:19,610
I can eject that.

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:25,601
I don't need this one, but I can go
here to Spotlight and say openrefine.

22
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:29,730
And I found it here, double-click.

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,780
And it asks me here, it was downloaded
from the Internet, do you trust this?

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,280
We do.

25
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:38,403
And here we go.

26
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:39,570
And here's OpenRefine.

27
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,560
And here it has actually two collections
there that I worked with earlier.

28
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,910
One thing that's also convenient on
the Mac, if you want to keep that icon in

29
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:54,680
the dock, you can then say, open Options,
Keep in dock, and then it stays around.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,980
And then we can go inside of any of these
data sets and start working with them.

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,632
So as you see, installation is
fairly easy here on the Mac.

32
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:12,632
