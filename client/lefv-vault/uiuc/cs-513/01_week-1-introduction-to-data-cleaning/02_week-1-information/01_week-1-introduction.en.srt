00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:12,230
Hello, and welcome to week 1 of Theory and
Practice of Data Cleaning.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,360
This week,
I will give you a general overview and

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,630
introduction to the topics
covered in this course.

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,002
Specifically, this week we will talk about
what is data cleaning, or data wrangling,

6
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:22,434
as it's sometimes called.

7
00:00:22,434 --> 00:00:25,809
Why is it important, and where does
it fit in the larger data science and

8
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:26,842
analytics picture?

9
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:30,120
We will also try to clarify
what data quality means

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,820
by linking it to the notion of fitness for
use, and

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,690
by exploring a few data quality
dimensions, and point you to associated

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,060
optional readings if you'd like to learn
more about some of these dimensions.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,700
Finally, I will mention the tools we
are going to be using in this course.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,460
After all, the title of this course is
Theory and Practice of Data Cleaning.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,400
After this first week, I hope that you
understand the role of data cleaning in

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,800
the larger data management and analysis
life cycle, and that you are able to spot

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,110
certain data quality issues and associate
them with a quality dimension and,

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,050
possibly, a tool or approach that could
help improve the quality of data.

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,890
In the second week, we will also
have our first hands-on assignment.

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,341
But first things first,

21
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:16,266
let's jump right into the first lecture.

22
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:19,887
