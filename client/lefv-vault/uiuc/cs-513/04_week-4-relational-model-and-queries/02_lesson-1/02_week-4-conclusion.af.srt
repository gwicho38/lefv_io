00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,776
Welcome back, now let's wrap up what we
have learned about the relational model

3
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:13,972
and queries this week.

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:18,200
We have seen that the relational data
model is based on tables that have

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,170
a regular structure called
the schema of a relation.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,380
A number of different query languages
have been devised for relational data.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,410
The common foundation underlying
relational query languages,

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,570
is first order predicate logic.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,995
What we have used here
it's more user friendly,

10
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:36,360
rule-based cousin called Datalog.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,620
In the assignment,
you will write simple Datalog queries and

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,680
logical integrity constraints
to identify data quality issues,

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,990
that can spend multiple columns or tables.

14
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:51,510
Datalog is not only helpful in
understanding the logical foundations of

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,830
queries and integrity constraints, but

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,300
it is also used in the real world for
specialized applications.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,880
For example the cursive
querying of graph and

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,640
network data and
in online analytical processing.

19
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,168
In subsequent lectures, we will then
look even closer at integrity constraint

20
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:12,400
checking in the relational model, and
we will use not only Datalog but also SQL.
