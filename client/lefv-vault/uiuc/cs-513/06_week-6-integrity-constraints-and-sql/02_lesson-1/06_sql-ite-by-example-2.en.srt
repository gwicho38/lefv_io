2
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:11,770
We're going to go to this website
from Southwest Carpentry.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,315
And they have a nice small
database called surveydb,

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,949
and we're going to walk through
some of these examples.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,195
So in particular, if you walk through
here, you see further details, and

6
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:24,660
I'm going to do some of that right now.

7
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:31,220
So I'm going to use, for this part,
I'm going to use my friend, the Emacs or

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,320
AquaMax editor, since that will help me
to keep track of what I've seen already.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,540
So we're going to run a couple
of queries that I have here.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,550
So we're going to start.

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:50,040
Maybe I'm going to do it like this, I'm
going to open two windows, side-by-side,

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,930
and one of them will
have the SQLite running.

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,920
Or you could also use the terminal.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,445
Again, I'm going to cheat
a little bit by using Emacs here.

15
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:06,438
I can go more easily back and
forth in the history, okay?

16
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:12,990
And we have to first find surveydb.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,770
Let's see if I have this available here,
anywhere on the desktop.

18
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,913
So I'm going to go to a sub folder,

19
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:25,770
which I hope has the serverdb in it.

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,930
Now here it is, okay?

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,052
So this is going to be
my shell on the right.

22
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:38,386
And on the left, I'm going to have
the examples that I'm going to go through.

23
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:46,037
So, in order to start the SQLite system,
again, we need to say sqlite3.

24
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:50,969
And if you already have a database, for
example here we might have downloaded,

25
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:52,820
actually let me do this here.

26
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,290
I'm going to download this database,
why don't I do this right now.

27
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,349
Download this database.

28
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,580
Okay, here it is and
it's now in my Downloads folder.

29
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,980
So I should probably,
so where are we here?

30
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,797
I want to copy from
the Downloads folder survey.db.

31
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:15,440
I'm going to copy it
into my current folder.

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,499
So as you've seen how that works.

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,210
And now I can run sqlite3
with that survey.db.

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,305
Okay, so
I'm using the latest version of SQLite.

35
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:28,652
As you see, it's from 2017.

36
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:32,180
Help for usage hints, so
that's not a bad idea.

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,970
And maybe the first thing I want to do is
I want to look at what tables are there.

38
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,322
So is there a command that
tells me what tables are there?

39
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:49,759
