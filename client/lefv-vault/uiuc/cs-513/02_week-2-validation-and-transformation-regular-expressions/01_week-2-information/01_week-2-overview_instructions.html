  Week 2: Validation and Transformation
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  Data validation and transformation refer to the methods of ensuring that data conform to expected structures or formats. Data
  <em>
   validation
  </em>
  ensures that data match defined rules; whereas data
  <em>
   transformations
  </em>
  are used to convert from one structure or format to another. This week we will learn about regular expressions, a popular and widespread formalism used in both validation and transformation. A regular expression (or
  <em>
   regex
  </em>
  ) can be used to match patterns in text data and to extract data from the text. We will first have a brief look at where regular expressions come from (computer science theory) and then take a closer look at the practice of regular expressions. The first hands-on assignment requires the definition of some simple (or not so simple) regular expressions to match common data strings, such as dates or email addresses.

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand the role of validation and transformation in the data cleaning pipeline and how they can be implemented using regular expressions.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Interpret how regular expressions and regular languages fit in a larger theoretical framework of formal languages studied in computer science.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    From a practical point of view, apply real-world regular expressions to match certain patterns in order to determine whether a data string corresponds to a standard format or not, say the ISO date format.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Key Phrases/Concepts
 </h2>
 <p>
  Keep your eyes open for the following key terms or phrases as you interact with the lectures and complete the activities.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    The basic regex constructors: in
    <em>
     theory
    </em>
    :  basic label L; and inductively defined expressions such as R|R,  RR, R*.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    In contrast, in
    <em>
     practice
    </em>
    we have additional operators (e.g., for convenience:  R? or R+) and constructs that are crucial for getting things done in practice (e.g., character sets [..], groups (..), special characters \s, \w, \W, etc.).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    False negatives: the regex should match, but doesn't.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    False positives: the regex matches, but shouldn't.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Not everything that could (in theory) be done with regular expressions, should be done. A "division of labor" (or separation of concerns)  uses regex for syntactic issues and code ("business logic") for semantics issues.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Regular expressions are not only useful for matching and validation of data patterns, but also for extracting and transformation of data.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching lectures and working on assignments throughout the module.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    What are regular expressions and how can they help in the larger data cleaning and analysis life-cycle?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How would you describe a syntactic pattern, say for a floating point number - in theory (e.g., using a grammar) vs. in practice (using a regex)?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What can and can't you do with regular expressions?
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
