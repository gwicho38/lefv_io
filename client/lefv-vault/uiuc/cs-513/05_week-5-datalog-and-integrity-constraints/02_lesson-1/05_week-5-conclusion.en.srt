00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,769
Welcome back.

2
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:11,619
Now let's wrap up what we have learned about

3
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,634
the data log queries and integrity constraints this week.

4
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:17,000
In our overall data cleaning workflow,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,655
we have arrived at the logical or semantic level,

6
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:24,254
where we use logic-based integrity constraints to check the consistency of data.

7
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,445
We have seen how to express integrity constraints as

8
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,535
special data look rules in denial form.

9
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:33,890
These senile queries can be used to identify the troublemakers, that is,

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,009
the parts of the data that is implicated in a consistency violation.

11
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,840
We also briefly looked at recursive queries and data log.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,979
In upcoming lectures, we will then revisit the topic of recursive queries,

13
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,515
for example, when querying provenance graphs.

14
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,390
Before doing so, however,

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,125
we will first transfer our new skills from data log to SQL.

16
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,609
This will be the topic next week.
