1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,740
So we have developed sort of a bridge between

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,793
two provenance tools ours called, yesWorkflow.

3
00:00:13,793 --> 00:00:15,759
Another one called, noWorkflow.

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,109
And in particular, the no workflow tool creates these very large,

5
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,074
very detailed graphs of Python runs.

6
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:25,704
But this really explains the provenance in terms of the script.

7
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:27,149
So in terms of function calls,

8
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:28,934
variable updates and so on.

9
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,574
It is often very hard,

10
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:33,479
even if you zoom in and even if you filter out stuff,

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,079
to see what the overall data flow is.

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,354
For example here, if you want to know what is the lineage of

13
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:46,320
this particular image, DRT240_11000_(electron vault) eV_002.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,579
Well, it is expressed in terms that are not really directly

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,725
related to how you might think about this script or this workflow.

16
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:57,869
It is explained, well there are print commands you know,

17
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:01,869
or formatting commands, there are assignments to variables.

18
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:05,984
So, it is what you get when you trace a program or script.

19
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,650
It explains this in terms of the code.

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,984
It does not explain it in terms of

21
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:13,739
the high level data artifacts that you care

22
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,900
about and the computational steps that you kind of,

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,609
or you abstract lots of little details into one.

24
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,269
It has all the details.

25
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:24,135
So this is like looking sometimes for needle in a haystack,

26
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:27,390
resembles stock or not seeing the forest for the trees.

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,189
I like to think of it that way.

28
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,409
And so what we've done together with the colleagues who developed

29
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,640
this tool is we tried to get the best of both worlds.

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,689
And this is we're going to show you in the hands on demos.

31
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,765
So, I briefly mentioned this before, just so you know,

32
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:44,385
we keep query prospective provenance information all by itself.

33
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:48,465
So if you wanted to know what does a corrected image depend on.

34
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:52,004
I don't even need to run the script if my model is correct,

35
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:55,049
the one where I explicitly declared what the dependencies are.

36
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,075
If I declared that correctly,

37
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,799
I can just go upstream here in

38
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,739
this graph and there's a lot of stuff here on the left hand side.

39
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,510
It's not quite exactly my cut out of that but there's a lot of stuff

40
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,694
that in this diagram that does not influence corrected image.

41
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:14,935
So if I'm only interested what went into the corrected image, this thing's over here,

42
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:19,991
the rejection log or-- that does not have an influence on that. How would I know that?

43
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,775
By running a query on this?

44
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,175
Yes! For a flow model.

45
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:24,599
So here I run a query and say, "Well,

46
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,050
show me what is upstream of corrected image".

47
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,250
Those are the only things that could have influenced the result.

48
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,449
Either way there's no guarantee that they all in fact

49
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:36,289
have influenced it but they could have based on the model.

50
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,560
But everything that's not shown here,

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,479
the model is correct should not have influenced this result.

52
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:46,034
So, even on the prospective provenance graph or the workflow which is call it,

53
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:49,439
itself we can ask interesting questions and then,

54
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,150
we can kind of marry if you like or create alias or maybe,

55
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,495
it's maybe another a very tight coupling,

56
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:57,900
it's not a tight marriage.

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,900
It's more of an acquaintances relationship,

58
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,080
I guess, between yesWorkflow and noWorkflow.

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,870
So we have basically two different accounts,

60
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,669
two different world views of a particular script and it's execution.

61
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,884
And what the goal here is then is to bring those together.

62
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:18,810
And so we had to build sort of a link between them and this link is established

63
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,003
essentially through rules where we have information in one database schema,

64
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,764
the one that noWorkflow has.

65
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:26,245
And then, another schema,

66
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,770
the one that yesWorkflow has.

67
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,224
And then we have to use some sort of identifiers,

68
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:32,219
names, locations of folders,

69
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,395
and so on, file names.

70
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:35,504
Things like that to build that bridge.

71
00:03:35,504 --> 00:03:37,469
And when it's all said and done,

72
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,625
you can see a diagram here on the right which we call hybrid provenance.

73
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,349
We call it hybrid provenance because it is

74
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,690
a combination of the prospective and the rest, retrospective.
