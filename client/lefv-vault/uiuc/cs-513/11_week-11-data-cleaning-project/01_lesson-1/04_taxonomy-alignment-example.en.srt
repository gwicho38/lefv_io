1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,938
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,938 --> 00:00:12,460
[SOUND] Let's just go back
quickly to our toy example,

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,820
with the geo-taxonomies before.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,640
So let me show this one more time.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,500
So again, we can look at a map like
this and think of it as taxonomy.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
In this case,
splitting the US up into five regions, or

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,640
splitting it up into four regions.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,870
In this case, one particular point of
contention is, is DC in the Northeast or

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,780
is it in the South?

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,000
The answer is yes,
depending on who you ask.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,210
It's yes in both cases.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,545
You can overlay this with PowerPoint,
which is not so ideal,

13
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:38,355
but you see already what emerges.

14
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,025
There's something that
was called the South, but

15
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:42,015
the other guy calls it the Southwest and
the Southeast.

16
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:45,025
And that big West is actually
cut up in the other, right?

17
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,235
That big West is actually smaller here,

18
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:49,650
that West is smaller because
there's a Southwest.

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,430
Or you can overlap it properly with a GIS,
which I did here.

20
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,310
And then you get these new regions.

21
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,830
And now the question is,
okay how can we compute this?

22
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,360
In the case of a GIS, we can use GIS.

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,980
But what do we do in
the case of the insects?

24
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,440
Or the birds or
your vocabulary that you have if you

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,780
cross walk some subject color works say
as a [INAUDIBLE] expression for example.

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,760
Now this particular example
can actually be resolved

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,140
on automatically which is nice.

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,397
We could try to solve the problem
here at the level of the regions.

29
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:20,061
We could have a mini taxonomy that
has five children and one route.

30
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:24,050
Or four children, four regions,
and one route for the US.

31
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,410
Or we say, you know what?

32
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,260
Let's not do that.

33
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's just go to the level
of the states and

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,620
we can automatic alignment
because we know the states match.

35
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,450
And get that.

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,560
So I'm going to show
that in a little demo.

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,080
So here is everything in one slide.

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,420
Here at the regional level, so
here we don't use the states.

39
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,950
I'm going to show this in
a moment with the states.

40
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,340
If you don't use the states, you can have
two small taxonomies corresponding to

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,380
senses and NDC vocabularies,
four, five regions.

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,120
The next thing you would do is say,
okay, let's put some articulations.

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,700
Where do you get those
input articulations from?

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,820
First of all,
what is the language of articulations?

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,980
I didn't quite specify that.

46
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,670
What can you say?

47
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,630
There's exactly five things you can say
in this language, is also called RCC5,

48
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,270
the reach and connection calculus
based on five base relations.

49
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,600
The five basic relations are,
let's see which ones.

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,800
Maybe, we can find them here.

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,770
First is equality.

52
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,810
We can claim that this Midwest is
exactly the same as that Midwest.

53
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,650
If you look at the map, sort of visually,
so this Midwest and that Midwest,

54
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,274
they look pretty much the same.

55
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:20,860
Don't they?

56
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,590
So, as an expert we might look at this and
say well the Midwest is the same.

57
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,650
Now let's look at something else.

58
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,490
What about the west here and
the west there?

59
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,930
So, there's two West worlds.

60
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,340
The West world according
to NDC which is smaller

61
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,790
than the west according to the CEN region.

62
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,960
So we make another articulation
with the subset relationship here.

63
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,010
This is our Blueman's version of subset,
less than here.

64
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,330
And so, we find equality,
containment in one direction or the other.

65
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,110
That gives us three relationships.

66
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,020
Then, there's this funny
thing called overlapse.

67
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,970
We write it like this funny symbol,
overlapse.

68
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,310
Looks a little bit like a joint or
a cross, for multiplication.

69
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,370
So for example, the claim here that we're
making input that we say that the west

70
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,150
overlaps with the southwest.

71
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,830
The west overlaps with the southwest.

72
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,480
That's true because
look at this part here.

73
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,250
This part certainly is in
the west over here and

74
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,710
this is in the southwest over here.

75
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,920
So there must be some states or

76
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,540
some parts of the country that are both
in the southwest, if you ask this people.

77
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,300
And not in the west mind you, so
then the southwest but not in the west.

78
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,920
But if you ask these people they say,
yes they are in the west.

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,670
That's the conflict,
that's the disagreement.

80
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,820
But we can sort this out by saying well,
there's this overlaps.

81
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,800
So five relations, equality,
inclusion in one direction or the other.

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,570
This makes three.

83
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,595
Overlaps makes four, and

84
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:37,010
also the fifth, relation, disjointness,
nothing to do with one another.

85
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,490
So sometimes we might want to say, for
example, the west of the census region

86
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:47,560
here, the west of this here, is completely
disjoint from the northeast over here.

87
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,310
So disjointness is, of course, something
that you typically don't want to say.

88
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,780
Isn't it obvious?

89
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,820
But, of course,
If you don't put that assertion there,

90
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,460
the system can generate
alternative possible worlds.

91
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,550
Where in fact the west and
the northeast overlap.

92
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,760
So in this particular case,

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,610
you need to just state all the things
that are convenient for you to discover.

94
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,360
And state them all.

95
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
And state them hopefully correctly.

96
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,450
And then the system will
come up with a solution.

97
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,860
And this solution here, down here.

98
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,110
Basically, corresponds to
a symbolic representation

99
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,590
of what the GIS system does
when you overlay the maps.

100
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,600
And I'm going to show
this in a actual demo.

101
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,450
Again, one more time, here's the input.

102
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,990
If you solve this, there's two ways.

103
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,270
We have these tool that we call
Euler because the diagrams,

104
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,970
its drawing, these trees.

105
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,730
Can be thought of as another notation for
Euler diagram.

106
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,380
With a Euler diagram, named after
Leonard Euler, the mathematician.

107
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,450
The Euler diagrams are kind of
earlier versions of vin diagrams, and

108
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,930
actually they more directly represent
the relationship between sets.

109
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,570
In vin diagrams if you look at
how different sets overlap you

110
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,380
know that you need to shade some parts and
color and un-color some parts.

111
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,320
In the Euler diagram if a set
is the subset of the other.

112
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,700
You don't throw out the normal
ovals that overlay and

113
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,410
then shade some parts as empty.

114
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,530
You just put that smaller
set inside of the other set.

115
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,560
That's the Euler diagram.

116
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,800
And we have sort of a tree
notation of that, and

117
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,150
that's why we call this the tool that
computes that Euler, the Euler tool.

118
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,600
So if you give this input, you get one
solution which is of the simple solution

119
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
that says well, the west, this west
is properly contained in that west.

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,680
So, the NDC's west is strictly
smaller than the CEN's West.

121
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,142
And CEN'S northeast is strictly
smaller than the NDC northeast.

122
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:32,115
So you see some concept it goes like this,
some concept it goes like that,

123
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:35,255
that's a really example, that's really,
the southeast is containing the south.

124
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:36,655
But then there's seas overlap relation.

125
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,395
Some of this you have set as an input.

126
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:41,575
So for example, already the input you
said that the southwest is part of,

127
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,815
overlaps with the west.

128
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,197
Excuse me, some part of the west.

129
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:49,100
So, they're really overlapping in a way
that all three parts of the overlap exist.

130
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,290
There are things about west but
now southwest.

131
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,340
There are things about Southwest but
not west.

132
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,136
And there are things about both west and

133
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:56,640
southwest in these
different terminologies.

134
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,130
But there's also overlaps that we're
not given as part of the input,

135
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,110
they were inferred.

136
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,620
The reason is not, okay, given all
of what I know, this must overlap.

137
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,960
Now if you want to look closer,
you want to zoom in.

138
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,906
When I put the, more of a magnification
of high resolution conceptually, you can

139
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:18,010
now resolve these overlaps as boolean
combinations basically of what's going on.

140
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,270
For example, you could say, all right,
you're telling me that the northeast and

141
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,740
the south overlap?

142
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,370
So how is that the northeast and
the south overlap?

143
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,081
So this is a child and that's child.

144
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,010
Well, the overlap, what does it mean?

145
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,890
They have must common descendants,
its would be a like family example.

146
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,865
They must have common descendants.

147
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:40,710
So, the northeast and
the south have a common child or

148
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,882
grandchild depending
on how you look at it.

149
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:47,210
Which is called the intersection
of the northeast and the south.

150
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,780
Sends the south intersect
with the NDC northeast.

151
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,450
This particular area is the one
that has the half smokes

152
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,100
because that's the one that is both
in the south and in the northeast.

153
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,970
So the times here is an end
a little bit like [INAUDIBLE].

154
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,270
It's an end so the region is both
in the northeast and in the south.

155
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,708
So although we haven't put on any state so
we could fuzzify that map.

156
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:15,910
It tells us everything symbolically we are
not at the resolution of the states yet.

157
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,630
However, we can already talked
about the parts where the concepts

158
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,740
overlap one minus the other and so on.

159
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,757
So for example this notation means,

160
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:27,216
we talking here the part of
the south that is not the southwest.

161
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:31,418
What CENs is close this out which
is not the southwest of NDC.

162
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,233
Lots of good stuff going on there.

163
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:36,980
So, I've put this
solution here on the map.

164
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,418
So, this is what the tool gives
us,this is what GIS gives us.

165
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:44,495
And because I picked the geographic
example I can see the correspondence right

166
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:45,130
directly.

167
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,790
So everybody agrees on the midwest,

168
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,980
because the midwest is kind of identical,
by definition.

169
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,310
So we can't make it gray.

170
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,260
Over here, this region with the hash
marks is the intersection of

171
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,640
Northeast and South.

172
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,780
So if you look very carefully
here where the red dot is,

173
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,920
you see it's part of this south, but
it's also part of this northeast.

174
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,541
And if you intersected them in GIS,

175
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:10,172
you get a little patch that's barely
visible here, has a bunch of states here.

176
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:14,222
And so depending also the colour
coding was really carefully chosen,

177
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:17,263
we want to reuse the vocabulary
that we already know.

178
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,486
So if you see a green term,
it's an NDC terminology,

179
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:22,430
coming from that one taxonomy.

180
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,250
If its yellow,
it's from the other terminology.

181
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,410
If it's grey, it's like it's in both.

182
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,630
Don't worry, we're all in the clear here.

183
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,788
But if it's reddish,
it means something new going on.

184
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:36,271
We did not have a word for this thing.

185
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:38,920
We did not have a word for
this little patch of R2.

186
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,010
Well what is it?

187
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,120
How is it defined?

188
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,400
Maybe we could give it a name.

189
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,180
Well, we could call it the NDC Southwest
intersected with the census West.

190
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,470
Maybe you want to give it a new name,
but that's what it is logically.

191
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,410
It has actually a synonym,

192
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,080
you could also call it,
the NDC Southwest minus the census South.

193
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,550
That's exactly the same thing.

194
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,340
That's a logical consequence of your
input, your input alignment, previously.

195
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,590
So whether you like it or not,
that's a consequence of your assumptions.

196
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,990
Similar down here,
well the Southeast, for example,

197
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,690
we don't need a new name for that.

198
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,830
So you see, we can mix the Census
Northeast and the NDC Southeast.

199
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,930
No controversy, we can all agree.

200
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,600
But up here we disagree.

201
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,396
It's part of the NDC Northeast or
the Census South, depending on you ask.

202
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,790
So we need to give this a new name,
a new label.

203
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,800
That's how we sort out
our vocabulary conflict.

204
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,980
So in this merged taxonomy we have
the old names whenever we can.

205
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,142
Let's say for example old and
new, let's just say for

206
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:40,910
the sake of argument that CEN was the old
taxonomy and NDC was the new taxonomy.

207
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,114
So we can have the new
name where it applies.

208
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:46,130
We can keep the old name where it applies.

209
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,852
With also some agreement where the old and
the new name is the same.

210
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:51,691
And then we have regions
where the old name nor

211
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,586
the new name, neither census
where not everything will fit.

212
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:58,978
And we have to make up new names, based
on intersections or set difference or

213
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:00,920
something of these old names.

214
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,979
And that's what this gives us.

215
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:04,650
So I think I showed you
all of that all ready.

216
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,003
And now I'm going to show
this with a little demo.

217
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:09,300
I'm going to show this live, okay?

218
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,660
So first, let's look how would I
encode and input like the one we have.

219
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,561
In this tool,
I write the taxonomy like this.

220
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:19,010
I say, here is the taxonomy CEN census.

221
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,410
Here's the NDC taxonomy.

222
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,050
And I write just the parent note
as the first note in the list and

223
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,190
then the children are below.

224
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,590
So for example, according to the census,
the US consists of the Northeast,

225
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,470
the Midwest, South and the West.

226
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,000
So there are four children of the USA.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,660
For NDC there are five, something called
the Midwest, the Northeast, the Southeast,

228
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,990
the Southwest and the West, is that five?

229
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,820
And then somebody must have given
me this input articulations,

230
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,830
these are the stitching together.

231
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,440
But there are consequences of this
stitching together in this taxonomy.

232
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,090
That's what the tool computes.

233
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,100
So we say, well, the USA is the same.

234
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,320
This west includes other west,
this one overlaps this one and so on.

235
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,410
So how do I run this?

236
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,750
Let's see where I can run this.

237
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,030
The tool is called Euler or
this euler2 align,

238
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,120
I just say align CEN-NDC
at the regions level.

239
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,340
We're going to do in
a moment At the state level,

240
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,670
which would also be very interesting.

241
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,210
But let's just say we do at
the recent regions level.

242
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,730
So it's a small taxonomy.

243
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,380
We run this.

244
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,770
And we get a possible solution, other
solution, is maybe not very easy to read.

245
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,550
But this has basically computed
the relationships that

246
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,140
are logical consequences of the input.

247
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,210
Let's just show these visually.

248
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,830
So I can say show the input visualization,
the original taxonomy view.

249
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,060
And let's look at the possible world.

250
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,170
So the tool has create these, has
created in a subfolder, these products.

251
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,510
Okay.
So here are the products.

252
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,590
The input is our original input
text file that we just had.

253
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,170
That was the input.

254
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,550
And it creates a copy for good providence,
you know, record keeping purposes.

255
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,840
But there's now also a visualization
of the original taxonomies.

256
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,460
So those are the original taxonomies.

257
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,100
We see that's, yeah.

258
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,780
The USA split into four or five regions,
with think of this edges as relationships,

259
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,480
okay, that's good.

260
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,130
But then we also have the input alignment,
so how does that look like?

261
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,460
So, this our input alignment.

262
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,111
So, some expert or maybe by looking at
the map, we've got this pink connections.

263
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,950
But we still don't know all
the consequences, how everything relates.

264
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,920
But the tool has computed this for us and

265
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,080
it put it in a folder,
a product called PWs, possible worlds.

266
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,430
This case is exactly one possible
world which comes in different forms

267
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,660
whether it's a PDF file, or
a graphics file, or a YAML file.

268
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,410
So here's the possible world
hears a single possible world.

269
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,190
In a way put everything together,
this isn't overly impressive right now.

270
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,790
Because in a way we give a lot of the
input already by the initial alignments.

271
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,481
But we know some connections
we can see some overlaps but

272
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:36,610
they were probably part of the input.

273
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,310
It also haven't resolved things,
it hasn't introduced new vocabulary,

274
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,520
it just says, the West and
the Southwest overlap.

275
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,940
And the Southwest and the South overlap.

276
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,690
And the Northeast and the South overlap
from the different vocabularies.

277
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,140
But how do they overlap exactly.

278
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,170
We don't know from this.

279
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:56,420
So what we can do is we run the tool
again with the sort of zoom in option.

280
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,210
So just like I ran the tool before,
I said align these things.

281
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,350
I can now To a particular
evaluation option called MNCB.

282
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,120
This means combined concepts.

283
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,450
It's trying to increase the conceptual
resolution by sorting out the overlaps.

284
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,990
It's sorting out the overlaps.

285
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:19,230
Bigger answer, [LAUGH] but still a single
possible world, the possible world.

286
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,700
Beware of the consequences.

287
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,750
So now we're going to show this solution.

288
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,880
And to keep it neat, we say hide overlaps.

289
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,340
Okay, so we look at the possible
world is just now being created.

290
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,930
So, you see this now as new folder,
just a few minutes later.

291
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,690
And here we go to the possible world.

292
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,070
This is just now created.

293
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,790
And I open it and now we get this.

294
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,380
And this should look familiar
you've seen this before.

295
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,170
Now, this is sorted out with everything.

296
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,750
It tells us now that the southeast
is contained in the region

297
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,215
that is the south minus the southwest and
also minus the northeast.

298
00:13:56,215 --> 00:14:00,861
So it has this higher resolution
where's the half smokes that's

299
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:03,741
CEN south into Sec south NDC northeast.

300
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,590
Now, how do I know that's half smokes?

301
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,110
What can I do?

302
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,544
Of course, I can often in reality
I can just go in my vocabulary to

303
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:12,102
find a grand level maybe
to individuals level.

304
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,490
If I don't know what the concept
stand maybe I can enumerate it.

305
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,310
I can [INAUDIBLE] sample it and that
going to be the last part of the demo.

306
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,730
Now we're going to go one level down,

307
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,730
and get a fully automatic alignment,
that way which is really neat.

308
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:34,722
[MUSIC]

309
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:37,751
[SOUND]
