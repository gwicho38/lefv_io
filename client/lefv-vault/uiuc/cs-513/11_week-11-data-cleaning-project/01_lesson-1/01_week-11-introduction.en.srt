Hello, and welcome back to Theory and
Practice of Data Cleaning.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,450
In this last series of videos, we will
look at the very specific data quality

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,060
issue, that is the use of
multiple vocabularies.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,320
At the beginning of this course,

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,360
we saw that different spellings of names
or places can lead to poor data quality.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,960
Our remedy was to transform, for example,
using open refine, those different

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,530
spellings into a set of canonical names,
or a controlled vocabulary.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,230
So clearly,

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,670
the use of a controlled, as opposed to
a wild variety, can improve data quality.

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,510
There are applications areas where the use
of controlled vocabularies is widespread

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,070
and well established.

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,870
For example, the National Library of
Medicine has developed many controlled

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,340
vocabularies for the Biomedical Sciences.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,730
The so called
Unified Medical Language System or UMLS.

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,610
It provides a mapping structure
among those vocabularies.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,020
And thus, allows one to translate
among the various terminology systems.

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,010
It may also be viewed as
a comprehensive thesaurus and

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,480
ontology of biomedical concepts and can
be used for natural language processing.

20
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:15,610
Similarly, biodiversity informatics
researchers use controlled vocabularies,

21
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,040
in particular,
hierarchical structures called taxonomies

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,510
to organize the different
Kingdoms of Life.

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,120
For example, plants,
animals, fungi, and so on.

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,585
In all these cases, the use of controlled
vocabularies is beneficial and often

25
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:34,193
essential in order to conduct meaningful
data analysis and scientific studies.

26
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:37,443
But what do you do when data
coming from different sources or

27
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:41,018
different times,
maybe historical data from 100 years ago,

28
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:45,113
comes annotated with different
controlled vocabularies or taxonomies?

00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:55,113
