00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:11,888
In this last set of lectures,
we have ventured into research land and

3
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:15,256
looked at new ways to align and
merge control vocabularies or

4
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:18,440
taxonomies using a logic based approach.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,220
You've seen how the Euler X research
prototype can be used to align and

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,430
merge different taxonomies.

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,030
In these final weeks of the course,
you will also work on your end to end data

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,660
cleaning project and combine various tools
and techniques you learned about here.

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,870
Specifically, open refine,
escale lite, and yes work flow.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,631
Good luck with your final project and
until next time.
