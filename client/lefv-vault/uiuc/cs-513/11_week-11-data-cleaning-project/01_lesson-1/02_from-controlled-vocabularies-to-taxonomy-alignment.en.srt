1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,781
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:13,382
So I want to talk about controlled
vocabularies and taxonomy alignment.

3
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:17,630
And there we have another tool developed
that can help with this problem.

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,710
But first let's illustrate
what the problem is.

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,250
Assume the following little dialogue.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,500
So Tina and Amy talk.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,080
Tina says, hey, any recommended
signature dish from where you live?

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,240
What's typical where you live?

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,050
Amy says, well, definitely
the half-smokes here from the Northeast.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,120
They are these tasty for meat lovers.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,109
That's the assumption, I guess.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,380
That's a wonderful dish that
we have in the Northeast.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,349
And then Tina says, what a coincidence,
we have half-smokes in the South, too.

14
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:51,730
Where do you live in the Northeast?

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,040
New York, Boston.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,830
Amy says, no, but
where do you live on the South?

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,380
And so in the end Amy and Tina says well
they are both from DC, Washington DC.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,530
So here we have a fictitious
dialogue where two people

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,830
talk about a signature dish from the
Northeast and from the South, same dish.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,130
Turns out, not only is it the same dish,
they come, actually,

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,510
from a region that is
both in the Northeast and

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,640
in the South, which sounds like
a contradiction, doesn't it?

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,970
Sounds like a conflict to me.

24
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,430
How could something be both in
Northeast and in the South?

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,850
Yeah, this is related to
data quality because when we

26
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,620
have data we have often annotations
with controlled vocabularies.

27
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,910
We use certain terms and
these terms might not be agreeing.

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,145
Maybe from a different context, maybe
we are part of a different community.

29
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,150
We use a different vocabulary.

30
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,110
And now we're all confused
what these things mean.

31
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,280
And so we need to sort things out.

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,240
We need to reconcile this.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,060
So here's the example, concretely.

34
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,050
This is an organization called
the National Diversity Council.

35
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,750
It has created a map of the US
with regions, with five regions.

36
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,290
The West, Midwest, Southwest,
Southeast and the Northeast.

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,030
And in that map or

38
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,680
splitting up of the regions I like
to think of this as a taxonomy.

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,350
As we will see in a moment you can
think of this as a geotaxonomy.

40
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,790
In this geotaxonomy the C
is part of the north east.

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,310
But we can split up
the US in other ways and

42
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,160
here's another taxonomy or another map.

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,470
This one derived from the US
government Census Bureau

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,305
where the US is cut up into four regions.

45
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:35,520
Yeah, so before we head up to the five
buckets now we have four buckets.

46
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,120
And these buckets don't quite line up.

47
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,820
If I flip back and forth, you can try to
focus on the certain point on the map And

48
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,280
you see it just doesn't quite match.

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,140
And in particular you see
that the sea on this map, or

50
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,840
on this geo taxonomy is in the South.

51
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,680
And here it is in the Northeast.

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,110
That's what the confusion was all about.

53
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,340
How does it relate to us?

54
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,960
So I have one slide,
it tries to explain it all.

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,740
We can use a GIS system,
a Geographic Information System.

56
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,080
For this very particular case,
to sort out the confusion, we can take,

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,152
okay say here's my one map,
here's my other map.

58
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:16,951
I can overlay them, I can do the overlay
actually in PowerPoint which is

59
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:18,421
the thing that I did there.

60
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,975
You see all these all
of funny colors occur.

61
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:23,473
So you can just use Powerpoint for
the overlay with transparency,

62
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,035
you can play with that.

63
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:29,980
Or you use a proper GIS, which I did,
and then you get to map on the side.

64
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,490
So you now see that if you have the
partition of the US into four regions, and

65
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,770
another partition on this case into five,
they intersect and

66
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,739
overlap in certain ways
giving rise to seven regions.

67
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,490
It's like you have four words or four
terms, the other guy has five, but really,

68
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,100
to sort this out, you should talk
about seven different things.

69
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,360
And the approach and the tool that I
want to talk about now is allowing you

70
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,850
to create that vocabulary of seven
things and sort out the relationships.

71
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,280
And that can be used in vocabulary
mapping Cross walking of vocabularies or

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,120
very particularly here alignment and
reconciling of different taxonomies.

73
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,710
So what do I mean by a taxonomy?

74
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,010
By taxonomy I mean little trees,
hierarchies of concepts like you see here.

75
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,390
Normally we draw them top-down.

76
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,436
So here we have, for example, the USA I
can split it into the Midwest, the South,

77
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:27,540
the West, and then the Northeast.

78
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,360
Now, that's the census hierarchy or
the census taxonomy.

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,080
This region is split
into these four regions.

80
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,310
But there's other people out there,
who for good reasons,

81
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,230
have split up the US into five regions.

82
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,780
Now they all talk about their vocabulary.

83
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,220
They say, you know,
this is going on in the West.

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,270
What's happened in the Midwest,
what's happening in the northeast.

85
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,870
So they use very similar vocabulary.

86
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,210
They might use this even to annotate that
data but if you don't know the context,

87
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,440
you are not aware of the fact that
the terms mean different things.

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,700
So in order to sort this out and
solve this possible vocabulary confusion.

89
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,540
What we want to do is we want to use
a mechanism, in this case a tool,

90
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,259
that first connects the different
vocabularies and then creates a combined

91
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,640
sort of uber taxonomy, a merged taxonomy,
that combines the different inputs.

92
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,650
So what will happen as I explain this,
we take these two inputs, then some

93
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,990
expert or through some other mechanism,
it could be an automatic mechanism.

94
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,190
I find what we call articulations,
these are constraints, linkages.

95
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,820
In the library information
sciences world you might

96
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,550
sometimes call these a cross walk.

97
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,090
You're kind of cross walking
between the different vocabularies.

98
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,560
And you assert certain relationships.

99
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,670
Maybe two terms are the same,
maybe Midwest is the same.

100
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:59,603
But sometimes you say, well, what these
guys call the South on the census side,

101
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:03,627
and what these guys call
the Southeast on the NDC side.

102
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:08,110
They are related in the following way,
that the Southeast is part of the South.

103
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,120
And then there might be
really messy situations.

104
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,890
For example, well,
first a simple situation.

105
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,370
What here, the green team,
the NBC team calls the west.

106
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,470
You see,
that's this west here is contained in or

107
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,220
is a subset of or is included in what the
yellow team, the Census calls the west.

108
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,850
So if you look at this west,
look how large this red is.

109
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,230
And look at this west, well,
there's something cut out.

110
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,830
So clearly, I mean clearly,
once you overlay them,

111
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,500
clearly, the west from here this team,
which is green or blue, yeah?

112
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,290
Is contained in what the yellow or
red team here call the west.

113
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,510
So that's why I get this one.

114
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,970
But there's a part that some
of them called the West,

115
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,600
the others called the Southwest.

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,300
So our goal is to do with
the general vocabulary,

117
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,750
with the general taxonomy that
may not be geographic in nature.

118
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,020
It might come from some conceptual domain,
some terminology,

119
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,360
maybe scientific names of birds.

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,270
We want to do what we can do with the GIS
here we want to do this in general and

121
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,040
to explain that it can be done in
general we can still use this example.

122
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,862
So the tool that I'm going to talk about
in the approach I'm going to talk about

123
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:22,260
takes this input.

124
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,660
Basically, what we call an alignment,

125
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,449
this initial alignment is input
alignment on the lower left.

126
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,230
And then we give it to this tool and it
will speed out a solution emerge taxonomy.

127
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,470
So now T1, would be something called T1,
taxonomy 1 the yellow one and

128
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,280
taxonomy 2 the green one have been
fused together into single taxonomy.

129
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,350
And in that single taxonomy, we know now
how everything relates to everything else.

130
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,480
In a way that's what we call solving
the taxonomy alignment problem.

131
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,890
So we have two input taxonomies and
one initial input articulation,

132
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,420
initial alignment,
how typically the leaves line up.

133
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,680
And then we want to get the combined
solution solution taxonomy T3.

134
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,030
In general the output can be unique,
that's what we want.

135
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,120
What can be ambiguous, because we haven't
Done a good job with our alignment,

136
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,600
we have not given enough links.

137
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,050
So therefore the result taxonomies,
there's many of them.

138
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,510
There could be millions.

139
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,740
Now it could be easily doable.

140
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,636
Or we have done, we've claimed too much,
we've made too many connections or

141
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:27,886
the wrong connections.

142
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:30,540
So now they actually don't fit together,
there's a logical contradiction.

143
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,510
We said two things that bite each other,
okay.

144
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,630
So in general we have unique solutions
to the taxonomy alive in property three.

145
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,020
That's what we want or we get many
T3s which is not ideal but it's okay,

146
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,110
it's a start.

147
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,100
But we have an inconsistency
which we need to repair.

148
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,380
We need something, we claimed something
like one equal zero, that's not right,

149
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,670
we gotta fix that.

150
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,620
This work came out of a real world
application, where this guy Nico Franz,

151
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,880
this is a picture from
a couple of years ago I think.

152
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,530
He works as entomologist, so
somebody who studies insects, and

153
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,560
in particular his speciality of Weevils.

154
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,150
I hear that family or genus that has very
many species, very many different ones.

155
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,670
And so they try to sort out
how they were organized and

156
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,590
their sort of phylogeny and so on.

157
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,980
We've worked with him so normally what
this guy is doing is going into the field,

158
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,650
having fun, sometimes you
question your career choices.

159
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,658
You say hey why don't I do that,
more field trips?

160
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:30,621
But he is not only going into the field,

161
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:34,849
he's also working formally with these
taxonomies that other people have created,

162
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:37,770
that he's creating and
he's trying to make sense of it.

163
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,726
And trying to combine them and
integrate them and align them.

164
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:46,170
So here is a third example, again we have
the green and the yellow taxonomy here.

165
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,562
These pinkish connections are what
an expert, for example, makes, or

166
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:52,798
what you get directly from the data.

167
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:54,810
And then you want to fuse
these things together.

168
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,250
So the general setting, again, is here.

169
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,730
Now here I draw the taxonomies how
they are traditionally drawn in trees.

170
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,710
And I have in this case
only grey the connections,

171
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,550
but these connections are important.

172
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,010
So the goal is given these taxonomies,
find the merged taxonomy.

173
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,890
That satisfies all the constraints
that are in the input and

174
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,270
sort of reveal everything
that we can reveal.

175
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,160
And so in this case, and
this might not be obvious,

176
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,535
we have a combination of the yellow and
the green taxonomy.

177
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,106
And the things that we
write in drawing gray,

178
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,910
the shapes sometimes change a little bit.

179
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,900
What we put in grey this is
what we completely agree.

180
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,660
So those are the ones that we
don't have to argue about.

181
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,022
So the idea is that when we
look at the combined taxonomy,

182
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:38,515
then the parts that are still sort of
original, we keep the original color.

183
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:42,826
If there's complete agreement between
the two teams, the two taxonomies,

184
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:45,887
we can make it grey so
to indicate complete agreement.
