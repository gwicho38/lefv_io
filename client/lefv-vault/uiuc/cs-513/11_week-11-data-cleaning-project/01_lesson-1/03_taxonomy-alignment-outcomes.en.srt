1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,355
Sometimes, when you make an alignment like this one here,

2
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:14,060
it's not obvious at all but it is the case that it is

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,905
logically inconsistent. You cannot have that.

4
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:20,449
It's like saying X is greater than Y or that Y is also greater than X.

5
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,890
Well, that just does not work.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,324
You can't have that. We can't say that two sets overlap and they're also disjointed.

7
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,620
It just doesn't work.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,714
But if you put this in an input alignment,

9
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:31,429
it's not obvious that it's inconsistent.

10
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:35,229
So what you need to do that is to debug or repair your alignment.

11
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:36,759
And what we create there,

12
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,630
so we've developed an approach or adopted

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,799
an approach that's called model-based diagnosis. Here's an example.

14
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,530
There's four input articulation,

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,890
so the expert has made four connections that he or she thinks reflect reality,

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,460
and those sort of four connection,

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,024
there's two less than or three less than and one equals.

18
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,339
And together with the taxonomies,

19
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:55,789
you can show that that leads to a logical contradiction.

20
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,924
These four articulations, these four input articulations,

21
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:02,734
A1 through A4, taken together are logically inconsistent.

22
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:03,920
So what the system can do,

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,650
the tool can do is, OK,

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,480
let's find, let's look at all the subsets,

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,825
maybe some of them at least work.

26
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:11,504
And what this is saying is that A1, A2,

27
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,299
A4 and A1, A3, A4 and A2, A3,

28
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:15,765
A4 – those combinations actually do work.

29
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,420
But putting A1, A2,

30
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,799
and A3 together already,

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,430
only three out of the four already create trouble.

32
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,849
And, I highlighted these particular – the green and the red one,

33
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:28,430
as the green ones are called the

34
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,950
maximum consistent subsets of the ones that you want to have,

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,904
and the red are the minimal inconsistent.

36
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:37,670
So you can either try to start

37
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,674
from the green end and then just add something to it. That still works.

38
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:44,075
You know that's something that you're trying to add to it,

39
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:46,275
it can't be an A3 for this combination;

40
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,484
it cannot be an A2 for this combination;

41
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,829
and it cannot be an A1.

42
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,250
It must be another A1,

43
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,760
so to say, that you have to plug in.

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,170
Or you can look at these three and say,

45
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,700
"Well, why are these inconsistent anyway?"

46
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,219
So there's something, maybe my A1,

47
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,470
A2, and A3 don't quite work together.

48
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,909
If you then pick something that is consistent,

49
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:07,099
then you might drop off the other end of the pool or the other end of the cliff.

50
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,680
You say now that I've repaired it,

51
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,030
maybe you look at this world: A2, A3, A4.

52
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,099
There's still something missing,

53
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,780
that A1 still hasn't been quite prepared to.

54
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,550
So now you might have an ambiguous situation.

55
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,449
Given the input, if you drop one of the constraints,

56
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,590
let's say A1 – I don't know which one of these is A1,

57
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,500
but one of these four links is A1.

58
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,625
If you drop that,

59
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,430
now you get different solutions.

60
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,240
You say, well maybe B is below E or E is below B. OK,

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,835
well, that's a difference.

62
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:37,550
F is below C or C is below F. Or maybe this is how they look: B,

63
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,425
C, and A in one taxonomy are related to the other taxo-.

64
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:43,310
So, the yellow team, the yellow taxonomy,

65
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,086
is kind of a hat on top of the green taxonomy,

66
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:49,960
or they're more into leaf like this. We don't know this.

67
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,419
So, in general, what the tool is doing – we start here at the top –

68
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:56,930
this is kind of the workflow of the taxonomy alignment problem.

69
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,199
We start with two taxonomies in the set of articulations, the A's.

70
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,814
This is modeled in logic.

71
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,250
Then we start up, and now here's a little bit of an AI system if you like.

72
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,854
That's a logic-based system.

73
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,555
We have different reasoners here at our disposal.

74
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:10,669
And once we do this,

75
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,305
we get either a unique solution,

76
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:14,419
in which case we can stop and declare victory;

77
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:16,444
or, we get an inconsistent solution,

78
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:20,455
in which case we have to do this diagnosis and look at the maximal consistent subsets,

79
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:24,125
try to extend those or we repair the minimal inconsistent ones,

80
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,699
and then we go back and try again.

81
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:26,905
So that's the inconsistent case.

82
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,159
Or if it's ambiguous,

83
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,275
then we get lots of possible worlds.

84
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:32,030
We can say, "Well, it's ambiguous. We're done."

85
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,000
Or you try to pick one of the possible worlds and argue for it,

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,350
and then say, "Well, this is the possible world that I think that reflects reality."

87
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,400
And then you can extract

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,979
a smallest subset of input articulations that gives you that world.

89
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,215
It feels like a little bit cheating because you say.

90
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:48,064
"OK, your input was ambiguous."

91
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:49,599
Here's like a bouquet.

92
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,425
Here's a set of options,

93
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:53,354
and then you pick one set. This is how it should be.

94
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:55,340
But the tool will then allow you to say,

95
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,939
"OK, if this is what you want.

96
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,534
Here are the inputs that you should have assumed to get that."

97
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:03,009
And then you can argue about the validity of those input alignments.

98
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,685
So here's some more realistic examples.

99
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:09,674
So for example, this is a particular Weevil classification,

100
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:11,580
actually two Weevil classifications.

101
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,656
I think this guy's called Paralescus,

102
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:15,889
but hey, I'm not the insect guy here.

103
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,569
So there were two different taxonomies given: the yellow one and the green one.

104
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:22,579
One was maybe, let's say, from 2005.

105
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,154
The other one was from '95.

106
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:26,980
And the expert kind of does a reassessment in the year,

107
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,894
maybe 2015, says, "OK,

108
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,439
let me look at what these guys have done.

109
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,254
What these guys have done, I'm going to connect these up."

110
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:34,723
Or maybe, one is the preexisting taxonomy

111
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:37,579
and one is the new one that the scientist is proposing.

112
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,680
And in order to propose this new taxonomy,

113
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,530
it would be very helpful if you would link it to the old one,

114
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,540
so it's clear what it is that you're actually claiming.

115
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,639
So in this particular case, it's from a real example,

116
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,915
so it's published in the literature.

117
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,670
You would get this result.

118
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,430
So there's a lot of names that the both taxonomies

119
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,550
agree and the both vocabularies have really congruent terms.

120
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,549
But then, there's also lots of overlap situations.

121
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,560
These dash lines correspond to an overlap.

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,870
So for example, concept number 20 here –

123
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,410
this is just to keep the examples of easily to reference.

124
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,504
This 20 here in taxonomy one is contained sort of a subset of what taxonomy two calls 44.

125
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:13,634
So 20 is a subset of 44.

126
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:18,725
But it's not as pretty as that because there's another concept here,

127
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:21,584
47, that's sort of smaller than 44,

128
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:24,459
and that one overlaps with 120.

129
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,629
So the relationships between the different nodes or

130
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,704
different sets or different classes can be rather complex,

131
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:33,750
but at least, now you know how it looks.
