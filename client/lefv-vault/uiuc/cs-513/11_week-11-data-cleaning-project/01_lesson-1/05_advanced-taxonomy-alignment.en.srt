2
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:11,074
We have now a variant of
the problem where we look at two

3
00:00:11,074 --> 00:00:14,105
taxonomies where the vocabularies
of one level deeper.

4
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:16,575
Instead of aligning it at
the region level, we say, well,

5
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:18,635
let the states speak for themselves.

6
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:22,395
So we say, okay, according to the census,
the US consists of four regions.

7
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:24,615
But each of those four regions,
we spell it out.

8
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:28,995
We just spell out the Northeast has these,
the Midwest has that, the South has that,

9
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:29,765
and the West has that.

10
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:34,495
Now, for our second taxonomy, NDC,
we say, well, the USA has five regions.

11
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:37,430
And now we spell out what
the five regions are.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,860
And here's the benefit of this.

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,032
Because we went down one level
further into the vocabulary,

14
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:45,610
sort of looking more closely,
now the articulation we get for free.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,540
It's a long articulation,
but it's totally trivial.

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,130
It's all equals, nothing about overlap and
contained in and whatnot.

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,980
It's just now the leaves, because we
went further down, it's all clear.

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,730
So in a way, this problem is now larger,

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,854
because we have more terms
in our vocabularies.

20
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:00,451
It's going to actually
run a little longer.

21
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,105
But the relationships at the bottom,
in this particular case,

22
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,329
were completely automatically generated,
right?

23
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,597
Because the states are just the same.

24
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:08,570
So we're going to run this example.

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,027
Okay, so this example is called,

26
00:01:12,027 --> 00:01:16,928
so we're going to say
align CEN-NDC-with-DC.

27
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:21,220
Now, this is going to take I think about
30 seconds or so, or maybe a little less.

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,490
The reasoning approach that we use
here is called answer set programming.

29
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,614
You might recall that you've
been using that already.

30
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:33,309
There it comes,
it's going to have a lot of output data.

31
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:37,100
And you've used this system,
it's called TLV.

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,360
You used it, for example,
to enumerate different repair solutions.

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,770
If you have an integrity constraint,

34
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,910
you can use State & Local SQL
to find the violations.

35
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,238
But then you can use this answer set
programming solution to create multiple

36
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:49,437
worlds, multiple fixes.

37
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:51,027
And we're kind of using
that same idea here.

38
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,636
But we've computed the solution,

39
00:01:52,636 --> 00:01:54,838
it doesn't look very pretty in ASCII,
does it?

40
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,426
So we're going to show
it as a possible world.

41
00:01:57,426 --> 00:02:01,377
Actually, I'm going to show the taxonomies
first, then I'm going to show the input

42
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:04,740
visualization, and then I'm
going to show the possible worlds.

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,210
Okay, in this case, that's one possible
world, and let's look at that.

44
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:17,433
So we have just created this new thing,
the newest run done at 11:06.

45
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:22,450
Let's look at the input first,
so first, the input taxonomies.

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,660
What do the input taxonomies look like?

47
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,090
So we have the West, which has these
states, and we have the Midwest, and then

48
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,440
we the Northeast, and we have the South,
and the same thing for the other taxonomy.

49
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,747
So we have the same two taxonomies, but
now expanded one level further down.

50
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:40,100
What does that give us?

51
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,970
It allows us to now look at
the alignment in this way,

52
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,370
which is kind of very simple now.

53
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,601
So we put them next to each other, and

54
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:55,420
all the alignments are equalities,
it's very simple.

55
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,330
So Massachusetts according
to this guy is the same

56
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,030
as Massachusetts according to that guy.

57
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,370
New York according to this guy
is the same as that New York.

58
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,570
So at the leaves, so

59
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,680
we point the taxonomies at each other,
the leaves we have complete agreement.

60
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,350
But then over here, what is the South,
and what is the Southeast here?

61
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,900
We don't have, I mean,
this doesn't quite match up, right?

62
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,350
Well, there's some things that line up and
others that don't line up.

63
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,722
If you look at the Midwest,
it looks actually pretty good.

64
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:21,740
That Midwestern state and those
Midwestern states look exactly the same,

65
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,570
if you look closely.

66
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,950
So hopefully propagates this up and
says the Midwest is actually the same.

67
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,582
But the South or the West is
actually different in the two, okay?

68
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:32,250
So that's the input alignment.

69
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,030
Again, this one in this case was
completely automatically generated,

70
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,180
because at the states,
there's no controversy.

71
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,570
Now, let's go into
the possible worlds folder,

72
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,690
where we have generated the solution
that the system came up with.

73
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,235
And this is now really very helpful,

74
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,690
because we have now the high
resolution at the state level.

75
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,390
Let's first look at some easy findings.

76
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,450
So, for example, we see here that
the Midwest is completely agreed upon,

77
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,530
so obviously,
we agree about all the individual states.

78
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,270
So at the state level, we always
agree between the two taxonomies.

79
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,100
But now at the regional level,
for the Midwest,

80
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,870
we do also agree, because exactly
the same states are in there.

81
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,810
But for the other regions, we don't.

82
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,850
So again, look at the rightmost part,
at the state level,

83
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,770
we are always in complete agreement,
but what about the half-smokes?

84
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,280
So, for example,
if you are from DC here, again,

85
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,410
both vocabularies agree on what DC is.

86
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,510
But in one taxonomy,
it's in the South, and

87
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,700
in the other case, it's in the Northeast.

88
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,970
And you see that now, right there.

89
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,607
So DC, Maryland, and Delaware
are precisely the overlapping states where

90
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:30,490
the concepts of South and
Northeast overlap.

91
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,080
So you saw earlier, when we modeled
this whole thing at the regions level,

92
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,740
we couldn't name the overlap.

93
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,870
It didn't have a name,
it's where they overlap.

94
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,530
Now that when we went one level
further down into the state level,

95
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,235
we got a better resolution
of the vocabularies.

96
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:46,955
And actually, another benefit what we got
is that we got the alignment for free,

97
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:47,795
it was automatic.

98
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:51,627
And so we can now sort out our
vocabulary differences and say, well,

99
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:55,315
if you're in any of these three states,
you can be considered either a Southerner

100
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,855
or a Northeasterner,
depending on who you ask.

101
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:01,240
Okay, and there are other interests,
for example, New Mexico according to

102
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,020
the Census is in the West, but according
to the NDC, it's not in the West.

103
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,250
In fact,
it's specifically not in the West.

104
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,420
Over here is the West,
it's part of the Southwest.

105
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,420
So you can read all of this information
off of this combined taxonomy.

106
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,380
So I think you see how a tool
like this can be useful.

107
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,401
If you align different vocabularies, it
can sort out differences and reconcile it.

108
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:24,702
I showed you how this Euler tool
works with a geotaxonomy example.

109
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:27,060
You see here, this was the resolution
at the regional level.

110
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,730
But once we added the states,

111
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,980
these somewhat cryptic names are now
associated with particular states.

112
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,580
You see here the states
actually drawn in here.

113
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,381
So we talked about New Mexico,
which I think is, these parts,

114
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:43,545
region R2 is the intersection between
what the Census calls West and

115
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,670
what NDC calls the Southwest.

116
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,200
So these two states, the Southwest and
the West overlap, New Mexico and

117
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,610
Arizona, precisely two states.

118
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,540
If we model it at the level of regions,
we can't pinpoint what they're called.

119
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,870
But we know such a thing must exist
based on the input alignment.

120
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,710
But in our case here,

121
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,530
we had an input alignment that was
completely automatically generated,

122
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,440
which is kind of nicer, and
we get a better resolution at the end.

123
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,540
When input alignments are inconsistent,

124
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,230
we have to diagnose the faults
that can lead to very big graphs.

125
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,190
This is now not the taxonomy alignment.

126
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,770
This is just the diagnostic lattice
that tells us what the problem is,

127
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,350
to pinpoint logic errors.

128
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,976
And we've developed a notation that sort
of focuses on the maximal consistent

129
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:28,860
subsets and
the minimal inconsistent subsets.

130
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,649
For example,
in a graph that has only ten nodes,

131
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:36,020
already you get 2 to the 10,
1,024 possible combinations, okay?

132
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,600
So now we're in a situation where you have
given ten inputs, you made ten links, and

133
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,467
the system said no.

134
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,524
Makes you very unhappy,

135
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:44,402
because you put the effort in
putting those ten connections there.

136
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,745
And the system says, inconsistent,
I'm sorry, it can't do.

137
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:49,897
I mean, A less than B and B less than A,
that's just not possible.

138
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:51,765
You can visualize it, but
it's not very helpful.

139
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:55,155
So we visualize it in a way that
the maximal consistent subsets and

140
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:57,939
the minimal inconsistent
subsets are highlighted.

141
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,020
And then we can look at those and
sort of scrutinize that and say,

142
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,516
well, where's the mistake?
