00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:11,560
Hello and welcome back to theory and
practice of data cleaning.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,120
In previous videos, we have introduced
workflows as a means to automate data

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,760
cleaning and analysis pipelines.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,160
We have also taken a first
look at workflows as a form of

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,690
prospective provenance.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,210
That describes the data flow or

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,720
recipe by which input data moves through
a workflow while being transformed.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,910
And giving rise to intermediate and
final data outputs.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,766
In these week's videos,
we will take a closer look at provenance.

11
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:37,060
Provenance describes the origin and
history of artifacts.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,210
Provenance also plays a prominent
role in the national sciences.

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,830
Where researchers are trying
to understand the world and

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,530
the present by looking at the past.

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,330
For example, biologists study
the natural history of life on earth and

16
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,230
specifically the phylogeny or
tree of life of organisms.

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,850
In astronomy or astrophysics,

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,300
provenance questions are studied
in an area called cosmology.

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,630
Closer from home, we may study the
geneology that is our family history or

20
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,200
someone's academic pedigree,
that is the tree of academic ancestors.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,680
In languages we study etymology, that is
the origin of words and their meanings.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,710
In the computational and data sciences,
we are interested, of course,

23
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,190
in the computational provenance of data.

24
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,420
For example, to guarantee transparency and
reproducibility of our methods.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,208
And to allow others to inspect
the quality of the processes that lead

26
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,346
to the result data.

27
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:29,395
As opposed to looking
only at the end product,

28
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,748
that is only a data quality itself.

29
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:35,018
In upcoming videos we will
also look at example tools and

30
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:38,120
projects in which provenance
is prominently used.

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,174
For this we will learn about the workflow
tool and the DataONE project,

32
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:43,029
respectively.

33
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:48,351
Okay, let's get started with
our lectures on provenance.

34
