00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,504
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:11,500
So I have here an example
from the fine arts.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,790
And I have a question that relates to
the following, one of these paintings,

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,970
the original paintings,
has been sold for nearly $180 million,

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,550
which is a non-trivial amount,
but the other one hasn't.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,260
It has been sold for a much smaller
amount, in the thousands, or

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,750
tens of thousands of dollars.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,230
But maybe, it would also be
worth as much as the other one.

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,520
So I'll leave it to you to guess
which one is the expensive one,

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,740
currently and
which one is the bargain, currently.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,680
But I want to point out that there is
a reason why one of them is much more

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,890
expensive than the other.

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,730
And that differences is the provenance or
chain of custody.

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,220
So we know that one of these
paintings was painted by Picasso, so

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,650
maybe that gives it away.

16
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,440
And in the other case,
we suspect, but are not sure,

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,300
whether it was painted
by Leonardo da Vinci.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,650
In one case, we have the provenance
record, we know for sure,

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,140
we can prove that it is
original work of art.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,460
In the other case, we suspect but
don't have the proof.

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,433
So this is meant as an illustration
how provenance, in this case,

22
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:17,380
in the case of art, chain of custody
records that establish the authenticity

23
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,370
of the work of art can
make a big difference.

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,630
And in the similar way,
we have this also with data artifacts.

25
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,940
When we produce data, we throw out results
In our maybe scientific analysis or

26
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,230
put it out on the Internet.

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,350
The value of these artifacts we
reproduce is often increased

28
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,360
if we document how we arrived at them.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,760
So that's the connection here.

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,500
So how is provenance defined?

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,360
According to
the Oxford English dictionary,

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,440
provenance is the place of origin or
earliest known history of something.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,180
An example would be an orange
rug of Iranian provenance.

34
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,080
So we have a rug or a carpet and
we know where it came from,

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,970
we may know the location and we might
know how old it is and so on and so on.

36
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,230
So how did it come to us?

37
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,590
It's also the beginning
of something existence so

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,780
the origin, and here's an example.

39
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,820
They try to understand the whole universe,
its provenance and fate.

40
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,480
Also where did everything come from.

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,580
That's a pretty tall order.

42
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,890
So it's not something we're
going to study in this class.

43
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,900
But it is useful to know that
this is where the word or

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,260
what provenance means in general terms.

45
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,960
And as we see in the case of art,
a record of ownership of a work of art or

46
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,660
an antique, used as a guide
to authenticity or quality.

47
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,630
So for example, you might have a
manuscript and say it has a distinguished

48
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,150
provenance, because this manuscript
was pass through certain hands and

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,830
you know its authentic, it is from
whom it is claimed that it originates.

50
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,750
The word provenance
itself has an origin and

51
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,370
it comes from Latin,
provenire, to come from, okay?

52
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,390
And that's how it arrived
in English today.

53
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,430
So you can easily see even using
the word provenance itself that

54
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,380
it is a useful concept that helps
you explain and understand things.

55
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,640
And again, in our context,

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,320
we want to understand whether
we could trust some data.

57
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,460
We want to understand where it came from,
and that's why we study these provenance.

58
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,320
So data quality is in that sense,
intimately related to provenance.

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,280
Because, if we have data of suspicious
origins, of unknown processing history,

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,110
that reduces our trust and
confidence in the quality of the data.

61
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,520
And then we might not use this data.

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,040
Now provenance also has been defined by
the W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,210
And they've come up with a definition
that tries to be of a minimal

64
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,080
standard that's brought
in all encompassing.

65
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,530
So W3C defines provenance as a description
of how things came to be and

66
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,970
how they came to be in
the state they are in today.

67
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,330
So that's very similar to the use
of dictionary definition.

68
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,490
But if we apply it now to
technical artifacts, and data, for

69
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,880
example in particular,

70
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,700
we can also say that provenance
refers to the sources of information,

71
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,290
including entities and processes, and
there's the connection to workflows.

72
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,270
Involved in producing or
delivering an artifact.

73
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,440
And then provenance is a record
that describes the people,

74
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,020
institutions, entities, and
activities involved in producing,

75
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,610
influencing, or delivering a piece
of data or a thing in the world.

76
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,910
So again, it's a very general definition.

77
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,320
They try to be all income passing and
we will use much narrower, very particular

78
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,070
notions of provenance in our context
in the context of workflows,

79
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,560
automation, scripts and data products.

80
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,060
But it's good to see that W3C is
defined a rather broad notion.

81
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,690
One thing I want to point out
right away here is that they

82
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,980
think of the word provenance
in the past tense.

83
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,220
So provenance is really as the name
suggest where does something come from.

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,890
So it seems to indicate really
something about the past.

85
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,390
But as we shall see some
researchers have found this notion

86
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,580
of prospective provenance which sounds
like a contradiction in terms to be rather

87
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,710
helpful as well.

88
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,200
So here's the PROV-DM, the provenance
data model, which is a W3C standard.

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,560
And you can find it on the web.

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,710
And unfortunately,
how these standards sometimes go,

91
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,320
they're part of a whole
family of related standards.

92
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,650
So I just want to give you
a glimpse of how that looks like.

93
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,350
So if you look at the W3C
recommendation for

94
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,840
provenance, there is the provenance
of PROV, as the family's called.

95
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,630
PROV for provenance, it's not an extremely
original name, but there you go.

96
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,740
So there"s a date model called PROV-DM.

97
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,440
There's an ontology, PROV-O.

98
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,130
There are constraints, so

99
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,220
these are constraints not unlike
the ones we've seen before.

100
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,820
Basically logic formulas or

101
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,480
rules that say what things are implied or
allowed and not allowed.

102
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,720
And there's of course a rotation when you
exchange providence you have to have some

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,810
sort of notation and
there were these works and

104
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,380
these standards came out of a community
effort and committees and working groups.

105
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,430
Here on the lower part of the figure,

106
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,130
you see how these different
standards relate to one another.

107
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,140
It can be a little bit confusing and

108
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,180
we don't need to go into
all of the details of that.

109
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,309
I just want to point out here
that there are a number of these

110
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,710
standards that are related.

111
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,450
So we'll going to mostly
scratch the surface and

112
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,170
then really look at the underlying
principles really more so

113
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,270
than the particular
details of the standard.

114
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,940
Having said that, I do want to
show you how provenance fits into

115
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,600
something larger that's called
the Semantic Web Layer Cake.

116
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,720
Nothing you can eat.

117
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,130
This is something that tries to put
various web stems together from the W3C,

118
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,320
from the World Wide Web Consortium.

119
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,790
You just see here where this is situated.

120
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:55,210
So there's lots of standards that
the W3C advocates and provides.

121
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,180
So there's things like URIs and
how to describe URIs, there's XML.

122
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,900
Then there's for
data interchange, there's RDF.

123
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,210
There's query language called
SPARQL that's somewhat popular

124
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,480
in semantic web circles.

125
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,210
There's RDF schema language, RDFS.

126
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,610
There's a Rule language and then
there's the ontology web standard, OWL.

127
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,470
So it's the ontology web language.

128
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,030
And then if you think of the semantic web,
there's

129
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,640
quality of something called the unifying
logic, proof and then trust on top of it.

130
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,310
So this might provide you at least some

131
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,950
context of web provenance fits
in this larger picture, trust is

132
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,550
derived from provenance information if
you know where something comes from.

133
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,830
This might increase your trust,
or you might distrust the source,

134
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,920
specifically because you
know where it comes from.

135
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,430
There might be even notions of proof, can
you verify for example the authenticity?

136
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,180
So there's technical ways to

137
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,020
check the authenticity of things although
this is not really the focus here.

138
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,450
So the W3C PROV effort came
out of a community effort that

139
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,290
led to an earlier standard, if you like,
called OPM, the Open Provenance Model.

140
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,590
And this is was mostly
a community of researchers

141
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,120
working in scientific workflows.

142
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,910
So there's another connection
between workflows and provenance.

143
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,680
One connection is, that workflows and
provenance are kind of two sides of

144
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,920
a coin, the future and the past of
a competition pipeline if you like.

145
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,310
But there's also another connection.

146
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,200
It is the scientific
workflow research community

147
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,030
who developed this model called OPM.

148
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,780
And in some ways the OPM model is still

149
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,950
maybe a good starting point
to learn about provenance.

150
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:47,250
Because it's maybe somewhat simpler and
the terminology is quite accessible.

151
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,140
So here on the left you see
different notes that are connected.

152
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,910
So the first one is A,
stands for an artifact.

153
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,540
Think of it as data.

154
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,620
And P stands for process.

155
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,450
So a process maybe used at data item.

156
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,650
So if you see that arrow going from the P
to the A backwards, that's on purpose.

157
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,440
It goes backwards because
the process used that data.

158
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,510
So whereas in workflows we often see
the data flow going from left to right,

159
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,510
like time flows from left to right,

160
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,550
provenance in the retrospective sense
typically goes from right to left.

161
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,810
It describes sort of dependencies or
what happened.

162
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,875
Where did come from?

163
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:30,510
So P, the process used the artifact,
or data A.

164
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,550
Then in the next item below,
you see that A, an artifact.

165
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,200
What do you think that label says there?

166
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,820
It's maybe a little small to read here.

167
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,250
But it's going to be in the readings.

168
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,980
So A was generated by P.

169
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,780
So if you want to use sort of more common
terminology you could say the process P

170
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:55,080
was maybe reading some data A, and
the process P was writing some data A.

171
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,540
Those are the first two edges.

172
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,130
But again,
it's in the direction from right to left,

173
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,130
the process used A, and
A was generated by P.

174
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,140
So this is really in some sense the core,

175
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,580
the most basic core of these provenance
standards in this case the OPM model.

176
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,375
And then there are some additional
relationships I want to briefly mention.

177
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:21,730
So the process p was maybe
controlled by an agent.

178
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,480
That's what you see there.

179
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,710
That's the third.

180
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,570
Ag that you see here on the left so

181
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,920
P was generated,
was controlled by rather, by an agent.

182
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,970
So what was that agent if the process P
was a human process it might be human, or

183
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,980
it might be a program that executes
a certain function, maybe a data

184
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,840
cleaning service or a look up service or
some other data analysis function.

185
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,180
So who's the agent there?

186
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,400
It depends how you want to model that but
it could be, for

187
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,730
example the process that executes it,
that would be an example.

188
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,150
Processes themselves can be connected.

189
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,660
So kind of, you're jumping over
the data that flows between them.

190
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,023
So normally the way I like to think
of workflow as a processes or

191
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:09,890
steps that connected through data channels
so it some data flow between them.

192
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,440
But you can also connect
the processes directly in some sense.

193
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,352
You can say well this particular process
was triggered by this other process.

194
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:21,939
And then in similar ways and in a way
a more important way is this is really

195
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:24,998
another of the holy grails
of provenance here,

196
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:28,720
this relationship that
relates to artifacts.

197
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,210
What do you think that might be called?

198
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,910
So we have an artifact 2, and

199
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,570
we kind of go into the past
towards an artifact A on the left.

200
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,390
So this relationship is called was
derived from so what does that mean.

201
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,645
That's really the lineage it's the data
lineage you have a new artifact

202
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:48,950
A2 that was derived another artifact A1.

203
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,036
Maybe it's an update maybe
you clean the dataset and

204
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:57,950
A1 is the original dataset and A2 is
the derived data set that was cleaned.

205
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,000
This can happen at the set level,
at the whole collection level or it might

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,140
happen at an individual record level,
or maybe at an individual field level.

207
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,030
So standards says nothing about that,
it's really something that you have to

208
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,040
worry about when you work
with these standards and

209
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,710
have tools that create prominence,
that keep create that history.

210
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,450
I should mention one particular
aspect of the OPM standard and

211
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,740
it's also has been inherited
to the W3C PROV standard.

212
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Which is, if you have a process,
if you have a chain that goes like this,

213
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,340
if you look at the first two edges
here on the slide, on the left,

214
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,320
you can say A was generated by P.

215
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,500
So the artifact A was generated by P.

216
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,840
And then the P itself used
maybe another A, right?

217
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,350
So if you look at the first
two edges on the top,

218
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,340
maybe you have an A2 coming out of the P,
and then A1 going into the P.

219
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,390
Now it is very tempting to say,
because the A1 went into the P and

220
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,110
the A2 came out of the P,
to say A2 was derived from A1.

221
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,190
Very tempting and
often correct but not always.

222
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,700
And it occasionally does happen and
there's good reasons for

223
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,250
this that a process reads something and it
writes something and what is being written

224
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,370
does not depend on and is not derived
from the thing that was read.

225
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,390
And since in general we cannot infer
that reading and writing something

226
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,530
makes those things connected through
what's derived from relationship.

227
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:35,120
This means that the OPM standard makes a
point about not implying or not inferring

228
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,330
from this chain that I mentioned before,
was the derived relationship.

229
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:46,560
So again if process P uses A1 and
then generates A2.

230
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,435
This does not necessarily imply
that A 2 was derived by A1.

231
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,230
It may imply or it may not.

232
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,620
It's considered a separate assertion.

233
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,450
If you want to say that you have to
assert that as a separate fact in your

234
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,690
Provenance database Okay?

235
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,560
So there's a reading associated with this.

236
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,130
And I recommend,
as we go into provenance in more detail,

237
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,990
to look at this, OPM.

238
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,720
Now OPM was sort of overhauled,
if you like, and made the W3C standard.

239
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,860
And so it has now a new vocabulary.

240
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,370
Things are called a little differently but

241
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,490
the underlying essence is
still very much the same.

242
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,250
And this new model is called Prov.

243
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,750
So you see on the right hand
the kind of a meta model of Prov.

244
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,170
So what are the things we
talk about in Prov a lot.

245
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,610
Something called an entity that
used to be called an artifact.

246
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,150
And both entities and
artifacts in our regular terminology,

247
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,190
we'll just call it data.

248
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,650
For us, this is often data.

249
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:54,000
Might be a data set, a table, a CSV
file or it might be a row in a CSV file.

250
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,190
Or it might be a field, a slot,
a variable even, in a script.

251
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,670
So that's data.

252
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,600
And then activity, which is now more or so

253
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,030
the center activity,
we use to call it process.

254
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,760
I mean, OPM called it process.

255
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,150
The W3C Prov model calls it activity.

256
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,090
And we could think of it as a step,
computational step.

257
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,280
Block of code, a function.

258
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,560
Yeah, in most general terms,
it is an activity.

259
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,400
That's why they call it that.

260
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,870
The word agent hasn't changed.

261
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,010
So an activity can be
controlled by an agent.

262
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,450
That was the terminology
that was used by OPM.

263
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,370
But the W3C Prov calls
it was associated with.

264
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,190
It's sort of a weaker relationship,
at least, a name such as that.

265
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,730
But by and large, these are the same kind
of relationships that we see in OPM.

266
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,980
And the ones that are really
important here are the used and

267
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,680
the ones generated by relationships.

268
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,040
They haven't changed.

269
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,760
So if you look between activity.

270
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,470
You can say an activity used in entity.

271
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,260
Or if we translate it into our
specialized language, we could say,

272
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,208
a process or step used a data item.

273
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,710
And then conversely, an entity or

274
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,870
an artifact or a data item,
may have been generated by an activity.

275
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,370
So you have this back and fourth between
data and steps, with data and computation.

276
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,200
And then another very important
relationship is between entities and

277
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,460
entities, or between data and data.

278
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,770
And this is the what's
derived from relationship.

279
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,310
And as I mentioned, the what's derived
from relationship is not implied

280
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,440
by chains of used and
was generated by relationships.

281
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,970
It's very tempting to say a data
was used by an activity and

282
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,600
another data was generated
by that same activity.

283
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,810
It's very tempting to say that what
comes out, depends on what goes in.

284
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,690
And it is often correct but
it's not always the case so

285
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,255
you need to separately
assert it in your model.

286
00:16:57,255 --> 00:17:07,255
