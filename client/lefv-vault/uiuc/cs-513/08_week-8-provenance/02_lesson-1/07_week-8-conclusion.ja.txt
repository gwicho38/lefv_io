おかえりなさい。 In this week's lectures, we have seen that workflows and provenance are closely related. Workflows can be seen as a special form of prospective provenance that describes data flow and data dependencies of data products in terms of inputs and intermediate steps. Retrospective provenance can be understood as traditional trace or logging information where runtime observables are captured that document the data processing history and lineage. In the upcoming videos, we will take a closer look at a particular tool for modeling, visualizing, and querying provenance from script-based workflows. That is, we will be working with the YesWorkflow tool.
