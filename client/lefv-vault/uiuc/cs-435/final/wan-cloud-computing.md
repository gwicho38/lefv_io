## Additional Readings and Resources

The following readings and resources are supplemental to the lectures: they cover the topics discussed in the lectures in more detail. You are not expected to read every page of these articles; instead, we recommend you refer to them as needed to understand specifics of material in the lectures.

In particular, we recommend you review at least the Latency article which provides a good overview of how the network affects web page load time; and the basics of MPLS label switching in Section 2 of the MPLS article.
