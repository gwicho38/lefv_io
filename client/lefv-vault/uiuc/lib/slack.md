# Slack

## What is Slack?

Slack is a cloud-based instant messaging and collaboration system. Think of it as a chat room that offers features and functionalities beyond what a chat room traditionally does. Slack allows you to create channels to organize your team conversations. You can create channels for a specific project, for a project team, or for a course. You can also send instant and direct messages to one person instead of a group.

In summary, Slack is a synchronous communication tool where you can chat with your classmates, course instructors, and TAs.

## How is Slack used in the Online MCS program?

Slack is a tool for you to get to know your peers and build community within the Online MCS program.

Each degree course has a unique public channel in Slack that you can join to chat in real-time with all your classmates. You can find your course-specific Slack channel by logging in to Slack, clicking "Channels," and searching for your course name. Select the course channel and click "Join." More information about finding and joining Slack channels is available [HERE](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel).

Check it out to connect with your classmates and become familiar with the Slack platform before your course begins.

Once you graduate you will be removed from the general Slack channel and added to the Alumni Slack Channel. This migration will occur about six week after graduation.

# Slack Etiquette

Slack is a great tool for online collaboration. 95% of students on Coursera have found Slack conversations with their classmates super helpful for their learning. However, just like any other form of communication, it could be easy to be misunderstood. So, it’s always good to keep the following Slack etiquettes in mind before you get started:

## Dos:

-   **Mind the channel's purpose and not the members' interests**
    

Each channel on slack is designed for a specific purpose, such as project discussion or career development. Though we could get a little excited to share a news article or a personal story, make sure you find the right channel to do so instead of posting everything on the most popular one. It will make information retrieving easier later.

-   **Send a direct message before adding someone to a new channel**
    

The message should help them form a clear picture of what to discuss in that particular channel, the general dos and don’ts.

-   **Acknowledge even when you want to work on it later**
    

You may get a question or request from your teammates on Slack when you’re busy with other things. Instead of leaving the message unattended, tell them that you have seen the message and would get around to acting on it later.

-   **Announce when you’re leaving**
    

When you are in the middle of a discussion in a channel on Slack, let everyone know when you decide to leave. So that people won’t wonder why stopped replying.

-   **Respect personal boundaries**
    

Use private messages when you want to share crucial feedback or correct a certain behavior.

-   **Switch to email when you have large attachments**
    

Slack is not great at handling a lot of attachments in one place. Whenever you need to have a long post with large attachments, you can send an email and remind people to read it in Slack.

-   **Make good use of the slack status**
    

Make sure you use the slack status which will show a custom message and an icon, such as “in a meeting” or “on the flight”, to indicate what you are up to.

-   **Make sure your notifications are set at the right level**
    

So that you won’t miss any critical discussion, but also you won’t be annoyed by frequent pings on less relevant topics.

## Don’ts:

-   **Do not bring your email writing style to Slack**
    

Think of Slack like a conversation instead of a presentation. Therefore, don’t write everything you have to say in one go. Communicating in one sentence at a time will keep the conversation going smoothly. It will help others process the information in real time.

-   **Do not ask the same question again, star the conversation instead**
    

Every time you discuss something that you feel might be useful later, star or mark it.
