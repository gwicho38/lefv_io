# Requirement: 

	HTTP Client - General Requirements
		- make GET request
		- filter response between (1) output, and (2) redirect (301) --- for example by using response codes
		- HTTP 1.1 
		- C++ 14
		- No stdout printing
		- executable --> http_client
		- write message body to file named 'output'
	(if 404)
		write "FILENOTFOUND" to output file
	(invalid arguments)
		write "INVALIDPROTOCOL"
	(no connection)
		write "NOCONNECTION"

	Sample Usage:
		./http_client http://hostname[:port]/path_to_file

		For example:
		
		./http_client http://illinois.edu/index.html
		
		./http_client http://localhost:5678/somedir/somefile.html

# Examples
```ad-example
title: Example GET Request
GET /test.txt HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: Wget/1.15 (linux-gnu)
Accept: \*/\*
Host: localhost:3490
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

```ad-example
title: Example GET Response

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 10 Oct 2010 23:26:07 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g
Last-Modified: Sun, 26 Sep 2010 22:04:35 GMT
ETag: "45b6-834-49130cc1182c0"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 13
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

Message is Hello world!

```


*Explanation*
		
	 - GET /test.txt instructs the server to return the file called test.txt in the server's top-level web directory.
	
	- User-Agent identifies the type of client program.
	
	- Accept specifies what types of files are desired ‚Äì the client could say ‚ÄúI only want audio‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI want text, and I prefer html text‚Äù, etc. In this case it is saying ‚Äúanything is fine‚Äù.
	
	- Host is the URL that the client was originally told to get from ‚Äì exactly what the user typed. 
		- This is useful in case a single server has multiple domain names resolving to it (maybe www.cs.illinois.edu and www.math.illinois.edu), and each domain name actually refers to different content. 
		- This could be a bare IP address, if that's what the user had typed. The 3490 is the port ‚Äì this server was listening on 3490, so I called ‚Äúwget localhost:3490/test.txt‚Äù.

	Connection: Keep-Alive refers to TCP connection reuse for future requests.

```ad-note

Note that the newlines are technically supposed to be CRLF - ‚Äú**\r\n**‚Äù. 

Only the first line is essential for a server to know what file to give back, so your HTTP GETs can be just that first line.
