  Introduction
 </h1>
 <p>
  Welcome to CS 421!  In this first week we will have two lessons.  The first lesson will introduce the course.  We will talk about why we bother to study programming languages and talk about some of the benefits.  I will also introduce the programming language Haskell that we will use in the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  The introduction video talks about some assignments called "Machine Labs"; you can ignore that part, since we will not be doing those this summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second lesson reviews recursive functions and serves the purpose of further introducing Haskell.  It also covers tail recursion, a style of recursive programming that enables a powerful optimization.
 </p>
 <p>
  The third lesson is about how we can treat functions as data, a feature called Higher Order Functions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Occasionally a typo makes it into the slides; when that happens I will post an errata in the "resources" tab detailing the error until I can re-record the video.
