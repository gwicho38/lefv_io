    - this is your go-to place to ask course content related questions for clarification on lecture videos, and any course assignments. Before you post any question, check if someone has already asked your question. Instructor and TA will attempt to answer questions within 24 - 48 hours after questions are posted. It does not mean that you should post questions at the last minute, e.g., 10 minutes before the deadline. It is highly recommended to check the CampusWire forum at least twice a day.
