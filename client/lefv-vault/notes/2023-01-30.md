## STIG

Best practice for configurations.

Mason has created Postgres STIG for containers. Doesn't have a lot of STIG implementations.

Container environment may differ and should be sensitive to the hardened environment.

> Note: environment needs to be cloud agnostic (for Azure and/or AWS)

```
for each c in cloud that finding details are accurate. 
```

> Note: PG Audit will throw errors --> but needs to be enabled.
> Note: Default parameter groups to be considered. We used

> Note: Use Mason's gfe for the cloud.

RDS Param Group and Connect to Instance.

Go through all the check text and see what we need to change inside of our cloud instances.

If something is not configurable --> gets absorbed

States:

Context: Accreditation requires that each project provides a STIG checklist for all supported tools.

Not a finding

Open

Not applicable

> anything absorbed by the cloud needs to be explained.
> Pasting urls that have supporting artifacts from vendor.

> Additional Considerations

	Some public guides for RDS STIGs
	PR: Lisa + Mason. Once Approved --> populate out STIG. 
		Customers affected: CDAO, DCSA, MDA, RSO
