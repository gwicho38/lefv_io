replace .com with .dev to get VSCode

  

Or press `.` in the browser to open VSCode

  

`t` to search files

  

[10:35 AM] Jared Morris

1.  `git checkout develop`  
    
2.  `git pull`
    
3.  `git checkout <branch_to_review>`
    
4.  `git merge develop`
    
5.  `c3 prov...`
    
6.  `c3 ui...`
    
7.  run test & check

1.  SCSS for the grids to make them fit the screen properly  
    
2.  add `description` fields to the groups and roles
    

  

[10:36 AM] Jared Morris

3. I think there's a bug on `activeTab` in the modal.

  

[10:36 AM] Jared Morris

may be a CL bug not ours, but it doesn't load the tab at first. Just a tab panel with no content loaded

  

[10:36 AM] Jared Morris

4. (backlog) have UiSdlJsonMetadataListener validate `mdaUserManagement`

  

[10:36 AM] Jared Morris

5. move the PTS-specific types to PTS, since FTD/GTD Has its own unique groups

  

[10:37 AM] Jared Morris

6. move UserManagementConfig `config/` "seed" data to PTS since it sets valid groups and groups needed moved

  

[10:38 AM] Jared Morris

for #1, you can probably reference SCSS from Nick's package in c3fed

  

[10:38 AM] Jared Morris

(OR) energySuite SCSS for data grids which i'll send over

  

[10:38 AM] Jared Morris

and inject via MDAPageLayout

  

[10:38 AM] Jared Morris

on #1 -- before starting -- add a UiSdlConfig to `mdaUserManagement/config/UiSdlConfig` and set Dark & Dense in the same way we do for PTS or any other app
```
