	Section 10 Foreign passport 2: correct full name, issuance date, no expiration date listed, no issuance city listed, and passport #: 164741). 
	
	Also note that you wrote that you used it when entering US as refugees - as shown below that was not your technical entry type (refugee is a separate code) - you were special interest parolees.

Permanent resident processing - I-551 stamp. Valid through 2/23/01. 

I-551 receipt number: SRC-99-137-50880. (You can add this to the card number requested in Section 9: Citizenship and update the explanation section. If you are asked you can confirm that the residency petition was filed in 1999 (second set of numbers in the receipt relate to the year)). Per your receipt confirmation lookup (available online) 04/27/2000 is the permanent resident approval date. You did not have to separately file for cuban adjustment - this is a category on form I485 which is what was filed. You were likely listed as a derivate on your parents' applications.

Also need to correct that place of issue says Washington, not Cuba or Miami as stated, done through travel agency. Also correct subsection - Traveled Countries, from 2005 to 2006)
