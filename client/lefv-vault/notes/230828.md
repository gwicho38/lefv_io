{@dsu}

september 13, 2023 --> defense forum.

From an engineering standpoint, we are still waiting for confirmation on the persistent low side instance, but good forward progress there and the commercial resource data, yeah, just I know we sent our certificates last week, uh.

So this would be kind of kind of be deprioritized, it's not a major need at this point, but it's good we have that kind of complete and I know the other than what in progress, Louis that maybe you want you want to talk about is really these geospatial payloads and then I'll end with kind of talking about this structured data for engineering.

I mean, I think to kind of highlight we were talking to the team engineering team last week really for release one, we're gonna focus and just integrating exactly why the base product has in terms of circles and lines and for that then on the the engineering said, they need to effectively where the inputs required.


### API Discussion

Modularity 

COR-108 --> take types from space force and titan and ingest into C3 types. So that 

	-> Persist Data

	-> Provide Types- 

    -> C3 Fetch API:

    -> lat, long, time
