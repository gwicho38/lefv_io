**Subject:** Proof of Affiliation for External Certificate Authority

Hi, there!

  
As a component of an application for a certificate for federal work, I require the following:

"A letter on company letterhead, signed by a Duly Authorized Company Representative, stating that you are an employee of that organization. A proof of affiliation letter is not a substitute for one of the above required photo IDs."

Would HR be able to help me obtain this?

Thank you,  
Mitch
