### client-side rendering (CSR): 

Initial rendering work happens on the user's device. 

	On the client, the HTML is used to show a fast non-interactive page, while React uses the JSON data and JavaScript instructions to make components interactive (for example, attaching event handlers to a button). This process is called **hydration**.

### pre-render (SSR): 
 (Next.js) HTML is generated in advance, on a server, instead of having it all done by JS on user device. 

	 With server-side rendering, the HTML of the page is generated on a server for **each** request. The generated HTML, JSON data, and JavaScript instructions to make the page interactive are then sent to the client.

 In practice, this means that for a fully client-side rendered app, the user will see a blank page while the rendering work is being done. Compared to a pre-rendered app, where the user will see the constructed HTML.

### SSG (Static Site Generation)
HTML is generated on the server, but unlike server-side rendering, there is no server at runtime. Instead, content is generated once, at build time, when the application is deployed and the HTML is stored in a [CDN](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/cdns-and-edge) and re-used for each request.

### Origin Servers
the server refers to the main computer that stores and runs the original version of your application code.

When an origin server receives a request, it does some computation before sending a response. The result of this computation work can be moved to a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

### Content Delivery Network
CDNs store static content (such as HTML and image files) in multiple locations around the world and are placed between the client and the origin server. When a new request comes in, the closest CDN location to the user can respond with the cached result.

### Edge

Edge is a generalized concept for the fringe (_or edge_) of the network, closest to the user. CDNs could be considered part of "the Edge" because they store static content at the fringe (edge) of the network.

Similar to CDNs, Edge servers are distributed to multiple locations around the world. But unlike CDNs, which store static content, some Edge servers can run code.
