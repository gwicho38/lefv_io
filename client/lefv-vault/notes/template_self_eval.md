## Self Evaluation

```md

BEGIN_LEFV:

(1) What are your Lattice Goals?




Write a self evaluation that describe my accomplishments for the last 365 days with the following parameters: 

1) Accomplishments are drawn from the table provided above. 
2) Each accomplishment (i.e., table row) should be matched to the  "competency". 
3) A "competency" is an element that belongs to a member of the following set: {technical capability, business acumen, relationships, and leadership}
4) The competencies corresponding to the given sets are defined as:
	1) technical ability:
		1) core competency: I'm an expert in a number of C3 AI core technical competencies
		2) enterprise AI application development: I accurately estimate technical level of effort for familiar and unfamiliar features. I easily decompose a complex product specification into an organized engineering effort
		3) process and results: I ensure my project team delivers high quality work adhering to C3 AI standards, guidelines, and best practices
	2) business acumen: 
		1) domain expertise: I establish strong credibility with business SMEs by engaging in detailed industrial and business discussions. I create safe opportunities for my project team members to deepen their domain expertise.
	
		2) analytical thinking: I lead engagement with business SMEs to clarify application requirements, functionality, and user stories

		3) I smartly articulate the relationships between the users, the solution, and the value
	3) relationships: 
		1) Customer service: When necessary, I communicate bad news to customers in a way that inspires confidence in my team's ability to deliver
		2) relationship management: I forge lasting, trusted relationships that withstand the ups and downs of projects and add value to C3 AI
		3) communication: I¬†structure my communication effectively to achieve a desired outcome
	4) leadership:
		1) leading self: I consider myself accountable for the successes and failures of my project team
		2) leading others: I delegate effectively to others, and in doing so, provide stretch opportunities for other team members. I anticipate issues for myself and my teammates and resolve them in efficient ways.
		3) strengthening c3 ai: I am a confident, knowledgable c3 ai ambassador in everything I do. 
		
5) Accomplishments should have the following sentence structure: <action verb> + <what was accomplished/delivered> + end result. 
6) The output format should be bullet points mapping accomplishments to their respective "competency".
7) Accomplishments may have multiple competencies (i.e., you are able to duplicate across competencies)
8) You can ask for further clarification interactively. 
9) additional context: 
	1) current position: Engineer
	2) desired position: Senior Engineer
10) Misc. Accomplishments: 
	1) Beyond what was provided in the table, you should also consider the following: 
		1) I led a software team that acheived CoE ("Center of Excellence" which really means "deployed application") in an airgapped IL6 environment. The application that I led had a fully integrated pipeline: at deployment, data could be ingested, integrated, processed, modeled, stored, and displayed to the user by way of a Node-JS based web application. 
		2) In this project I was responsbile for the application architecture and core development. This involved implementing features such as custom components, runtime caching and multithreading in python while maintaining efficient ui throughput. Code was developed with JavaSCript, TypeScript, and Python 3.6. 
		3) I was responsible for onboarding contractors. I was the first to extend and allow all contractors to develop on windows virtual machines. I showed that the c3 server could be deployed on such machines using wsl2 and docker-compose. prior to showing this, it was thought that developing using a windows machine and/or virtual machine would not work. 
		4) The team members on my application were new to the company and new to the field of Software Engineering. I was able ramp them up to where they can now self manage and are comfortable implementing advanced features. 
		5) I have interfaced with our customer subject matter experts (SME), have presented the application to our customer, and have led the application through executive (known as "PRR" testing).
		6) I have completed one masters course at UIUC, and am on track to complete a second course by the end of the Spring 2023. 
		7) I have been able to represent c3 ai frequently through my exposure to a shared customer environment with a c3 partner, MTSI. During my time at MTSI, we've been given positive feedback for our collaborative nature. 
		8) I am open to feedback and held regular office hours for my software team. 
 

Prompt sent by Manager with Examples: 

Context:¬†

Find the self-assessment prompts/questions from this past annual review cycle below. It‚Äôs possible that they may change for the coming review cycle, but it is not anticipated. Please make your own copy of this document and begin to note your responses to the prompts.¬†¬†

A suggested structure has been provided for each prompt that guides each of us to reflect on the assessment in the context of the 4 tenets of the FDE position: Leadership, Technical Competency, Relationships / Consultative Skills, and Business Acumen. ¬†

Feel free to adjust the structure if you find it appropriate. I recommend starting by adding bullets within each tenant for each prompt that start with a strong action verb, continue to describe what was executed/accomplished/delivered, and finishes with the value/impact/context of the activity. It‚Äôs ok to have a bit of overlap and list a couple items across multiple categories/questions if you have a particular achievement or learning that applies to the topic quite well, but otherwise I suggest adding a variety of experiences to document each of your many successes in the last 6 months.¬†

General Resource: [https://c3energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SAM/pages/1026818896/FDE+Professional+Development](https://c3energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SAM/pages/1026818896/FDE+Professional+Development)¬†
