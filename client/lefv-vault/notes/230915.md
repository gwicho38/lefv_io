 Platform deployed on c2e --> spend the next two weeks

 wednesday of next week there will be a demo

 stagnant front --> working with Micael to talk through what to try next -- Ben will be back next week and try and call while working through.  

can launch all instances. kubernetes workers are failing to register against the cluster. 

reviewing feature request && went through engineering board w/ armen

banner merge -> today

track data point -> today

path forward on map -> done 

link generation -> unblocked

eval agent for Cor77 and cor 78 needs to be integrated



```

- Ability to run a C3 fine-tuned LLM on a C3 node with hardware 8xA100-40GB
    

- Provide list of python libraries used in the orchestration for scanning
    

- Ability to configure ALL the LLMs used in the app (so there is no OpenAI call made)  
      
    Dependency:
    

Mapping service must be map server agnostic

For example, CDAO map must allow overriding map service.

Enumerate package dependencies and any third party extended dependencies.

Serving layer

→ hardware spec requirements → verification for VLLM → hardware and dependencies for it to work with C3 wrapper. CPU, GPU requirements.

→ C3 model inference to get into CORNEA’s environments.

→ spec requirements

→ runtime specification for the entire base app. plugins etc. CoLBERT library specifications.

---

Features in develop →

What’s feature complete for develop/release branch.

---

Agent makes network requests. These network requests should be replaced with a configurable LLM setup where we can point those to local LLM.

Note --> there is a ticket for this ongoing --> to track. 

---

Requirements for platform →

--> support 

--> similarly

%% update double check %%

Key Dates: 

October 15th --> 30 + 40 --> hundreds of people seeing this. 

Release 3 is going to be UAT.

Final release is December 15, 2023. 

The only core feature is the long user session on the high level road map.
