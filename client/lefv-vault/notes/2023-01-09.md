## 📋 Story

Verify that `cacDiff` grid fills entire cell (and doesn't highlight only the text). This behavior was observed in the secure environment. 

Example behavior: A diff grid would show differences with colors, but the color would not fill the entire cell. 

## 🗺 Route

	`/events/{eventId}`

	tab: data

	grid: 'Assessment Requirement Data Sources'

	action: click on 'Name' of versioned document to show diff. Observe diff output. 

## 🖥 UI

	No UI is available because behavior was observed in the secure environment. 
		

## 🔨 Acceptance Criteria

- Test ticketed and added to backlog.
- Application provisions with changes.
- Application bundles with changes.
