Annual Self-Evaluation:

I achieved key goals for our last fiscal year - with more work to be done. I successfully led the MDA PTS team through PRR and application deployment on IL6 by April 2023. In doing so, I created and managed our backlog, refined tickets in response to stakeholder feedback, and was accountable for timely feature delivery. Moreover, I also contributed to the delivery and deployment of GTO and provided guidance on features and bug fixes for FTD - helping strengthen C3's relationship with MDA.

In addition to playing a key part of successful application delivery for MDA, I achieved my goal for onboarding contractors (the majority of which were new professionals). In particular, working across C3 organizations (including IT and HR), I was able to develop the virtual machine environment that has allowed contractor onboarding on WSL2-based Virtual Machines. This work has been extended to support key customer initiatives, including those at Cargill, PSO, RSO, and MDA.

Another challenging goal completed over the last year was admission to UIUC's MS in CS program. By the end of the fiscal fiscal year, I will have completed two courses and am on track to graduate in 18 months. Thus my courses have ranged from Applied Machine Learning to Cloud Networking. I also completed one Coursera course and look forward to continuing my technical expertise by taking more in the future.

For our next fiscal year, I hope to implement a CI/CD pipeline for MDA PTS and expand PTS test coverage above 50%. In doing so I will leverage the progress made in streamlining our production application development.

Finally, I'm looking forward to playing a greater part in managing our customer needs. In particular, as PTS Phase 3 ramps up, our customer will be looking onboard new users.

Entering my second year at C3, I strive to be accountable, curious, and passionate in everything that I do, and I believe that my work this year reflects these values.

Below is an overview of how my work supports C3's competencies.

Technical Capability:

Over the past fiscal year I've developed expertise in various facets of the platform.

- Core competency:

    - Designed, developed, and deployed MDA PTS. Developed Platform depth as a result of large data throughput.

    - Integrated and designed runtime caching algorithms in clustered environments.

    - Developed and documented a "Docker Desktop" replacement solution, improving system performance and maintainability.

- Enterprise AI application development:

    - Led an application for development through CoE/deployment in an air-gapped IL6 environment. Was counted on to decompose complex product specifications into organized engineering efforts.

    - Led the architecture, specification, and development of an end to end data pipeline. As a result of the hard work of our team, the PTS application is an integrated solution that covers ingestion to user-facing visualization of generative AI data.

    - Provided guidance to contractors on core platform features and built novel solutions to address the exigencies of air-gapped deployment.

- Process and results:

    - Ensured high-quality delivery of MDA PTS. Verified that development by our core team applied C3 AI standards, guidelines, and best practices.

Business Acumen:

I've advised, guided, and presented core application functionality to MDA SMEs.

- Domain expertise:

    - Implemented key PTS features required acquiring knowledge of vectorization, multithreaded clustered environments, and client side caching.

    - Provided recommendations on future staffing requirements as a function of feature complexity.

- Analytical thinking:

    - Led engagement with business SMEs to clarify application requirements and functionality.

- Value creation:

    - Met and explained PTS functionality and potential extensions with MDA SMEs.

    - Created framework for future improvements requested by MDA as they look to onboard users onto PTS.

Relationships:

I've been counted on to communicate how C3 leverages the platform to explore potential business needs.

- Customer service:

    - Explained challenges (e.g., with respect to application scope) and business process limitations (e.g., where custom customer processes could not be generalized) to internal and external stakeholders. Advice was used to narrow focus and deliver a more robust application core.

- Relationship management:

    - Fostered lasting, trusted relationships with C3 AI and MTSI partners, contributing to the overall success of our shared customer environment.

- Communication:

    - Structured communication effectively while presenting the MDA PTS application to customers and leading the application through executive (PRR) testing.

Leadership:

I hold myself accountable for the success of development efforts. In particular, I enjoy working with new professionals as a bridge to build their confidence and leverage their talent. As AI moves beyond its nascent stages, developer self-sufficiency can help C3 scale development and profitability.

- Leading self:

    - Held myself accountable for the successes and failures of my project team, taking responsibility for project outcomes.

- Leading others:

    - Successfully onboarded contractors and ramped up new team members to the point of self-management and comfort in implementing advanced features.

    - Established regular office hours for my software team, providing support and guidance to teammates.

- Strengthening C3 AI:

    - Represented C3 AI during my time at MTSI and received positive feedback for our collaborative nature.

In what area(s) would you most like to improve in the coming months?

I would like to continue developing my leadership skills, particularly in coaching and mentoring others. Additionally, I would like to strengthen my technical skills in machine learning and data analysis to better support the development of enterprise AI applications.

Is there anything you would like to share with your manager regarding your performance and how you embody the C3 AI Values?

I strongly believe in the C3 AI Values and strive to embody them in my work every day. I value collaboration, integrity, and innovation and believe in creating an inclusive and supportive environment for all team members. I appreciate the opportunities provided by C3 AI for professional development and am committed to continued learning and growth.
