RSO-2607. Opening commit because I am moving forward with related ticker RSO-2108 while I can consistently populate WorkUnitCode stateHistories data. 

Added platform column, indicatorMapping, days in status column, 1-N column, and changed assignee column. Modified and added statusDaysAgo column. Version reverting seed data.

Modified AnalysisWorkflowState to account for CaseAssignment isOpen field expectation that wuc.simpleName (i.e., parent.simpleName) enum contain the value 'Open'. My review of the docs showed that parent.simpleName did not contain field 'Open'. I will revert changes if this understanding is incorrect.
