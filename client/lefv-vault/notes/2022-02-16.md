### Script to Create Vanity URL

Note: Use case for vanity URL is so that you can deploy multiple tags (in a tenant) and expose only a particular tag to a user. 

```
	let vurl = (addr, webpack = true) => {  
	  var context = c3Context();  
	  VanityUrl.create({  
	    id: addr || "localhost",  
	    name: addr || "localhost",  
	    tenant: context.tenant,  
	    tag: context.tag,  
						    defaultContent: webpack ? 'c3/index.html' : 'index.html'  
	  });  
	}
```

types of data: relational, time series

## Pre Development Planning
	# Determine what is being modeled

	# What are we trying to do?

	# Do we have data we need for the use cases defined above?

## Typical Application Build Plan

```
Here are the steps in your application build for the first half of the course:

1.  Inspect the source data 
2.  Decide how to represent that data in the application data schema
3.  Build the Persistable Types
4.  Build the Source Types
5.  Build the Transform Types
6.  Test the data ingestion pipeline using seed data
7.  Build and test SimpleMetrics
8.  Build and test CompoundMetrics
```

## Data Integration Pipeline
Operations:

	

	# used to save data in  unified federated image

	# db saved in form that can be used/processed by AI

	# predictions are served up to application logic
