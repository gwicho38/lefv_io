Action Items:

Eric B to file ATO ticket to create a mounted directory for runtime installation for DCSA. For now will manually ensureInstalled() on each node, post provision, prior to running batch jobs. Eric let us know if you need assistance on that (tunneling to nodes, manually kicking that off)
Eric B & Luis to file EXC to improve this experience
Sean & Armen following up with Jack to get PRR & PSR timeline estimation
Patrick Z to file ATO ticket for deployment automation scripts when he's ready
Sean reviewing RSO MDM P0 PR and figure out with Wills when Prod provision is planned
Stephen will include Sean & Armen on test PR for this regression
Jeff & Armen to schedule spec review for Transcom ASAP
Luis to follow up with his DM to file an OPEN ticket for his time off

Long-term initiative, figure out how we're going to solve CI for Fed projects.
