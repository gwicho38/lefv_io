BTW, I don't have a great reference, but when I do the fork workflow, I tend to:

-   add another remote (`git remote add fork <fork-url>`)
-   check out a branch (`git checkout -b whatever`
-   pull changes from origin to master periodically (`git remote pull origin master`)
-   rebase my local branch onto master (`git rebase whatever master`)
