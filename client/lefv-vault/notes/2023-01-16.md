## 📢 - Project information

PTS Phase 3.

# 📅 - Agenda

# 📝 - Notes

Similar sized efforts and borrow MDA COE.

3 resources for 6 months.

Finishing trajectory generation.

	Additional trajectory generation. 
	Now new design - adding back trajectory stuff from TGM to PTS. 

PTS has a new Modeling Interface:

	- no new deployment milestones until month 4. 

### Turn into Project Plan

# 💠 - Action items

# ❓ Questions?

	Needs:

		(Training First)

		(Reflective Component)

		- Emmissive + Reflective Generative
			- Could you generative reflective data with lookup tables. 

		(Lookup Table w/ MSLRD)

		- Plan - take C++ code to call MSLRD
		- Plan - determine who computes lookup table for a given threat

		- MSLRD lookup useful?

		- Where does the lookup table come from? 

		- IR generation with diverse object set?

	Area 3:

		(Bands)

		- Wider band range?
			- Is visible light emmission useful?
			- Other types of threats are useful.
		- Bands are settled
