MDF: set params and necessary types. Framework generates APIs that allow 

Driver: puts necessary props into MDF.

Q: What are batches in MDF? 

Q: How do you use IRGenResult?

What to persist at batch level?

What to persist at trajectory level?

Sources --> getInputData --> gets called on whatever the Model was trained with. 

csv upload upload 

use same data load for inference and training


all training data has Ir spec member

Two phases?

Persistance?
	

Inference?



ReferenceTrajectory ingestion/persistence:

	IRSpecRange: the user input rangers
IRSpec = a sample from an IRSpec range which  is assigned to a trajectory for inference

	kinematic
	ir spec
	keep track of ir spec assigned on inference
	IRTrajectoryGenerationResults.py --> persists inference + reference ingested data

	on inference 

ReferenceTrajectory generation: a single inference output for a given trajectory

	kinematic
	ir spec sampled
	some ReferenceTrajectory generated data will have an affixed IRSpecRange or a generated IRSpecRange

Generated Trajectory Concept still needs to happen. 

Of the generate trajectories, does the concept of a batch exist?

Mapping a spec to a generated 

What are we thinking about output files?

How do we visualize Batches?

Metric Tiles with the ranges

If you are looking at a particular trajectory --> we'd want to have an IRSpec for such trajectory.

Prediction Persister can drive the results output from an MDF model.

compression requirements: 

Button on Model Details page -- git button and create file to download.

Reference Data?

Download Model File --> API to extract native tesnsorflow/keras 

	keras model model generation needs to consider that inputs need to be the same. Preprocessing needs to be the same. 

That's what is exposed?

What is actually saved?
