## 20231102

hi - giving you the heads up about what we decided:

1) There is a genai and platform runtime incompatibility: 

	`Genai` specifies the `py-query_orchestrator` runtime [here](https://github.com/c3-e/c3generativeAi/blob/release/genai/genAiBase/metadata/ImplLanguage.Runtime/py-query_orchestrator.json "https://github.com/c3-e/c3generativeAi/blob/release/genai/genAiBase/metadata/ImplLanguage.Runtime/py-query_orchestrator.json") , relying on `pandas=1.5.3`. `Genai.QueryOrchestrator` and much of the `Genai` application relies on the `py-query_orchestrator` runtime. 
	
	The official version supported by `c3.Data` is `1.3.4`. `c3.Data` also uses `py-ml` runtime to execute Python logic -- which consequently uses `1.3.4`. 

2) Our packages (`guruSerch` and `guruSearchUI`) have a dependency on the `Query.QueryOrchestrator`. 

3) The `GURU` team will test two things: 
	1) Overriding the pandas version in the Track Tool (declared in our package) and testing.
	2) Overriding the genai pandas version and testing. If this works, we'll send a PR. 

4) Irrespective of steps 1 - 3 - the Genai and Data team will continue to have this dependency conflict. The `Genai` team may be the most appropriate team to perform the next work stage. Here they could version pandas down from `1.5.3` to the max supported version by `Data` - which is `1.3.4`.
  
 `py-data_answering` is `1.3.3` and it is `1.3.4` for `py-data` [here](https://github.com/c3-e/c3server/blob/release/platform/platform/src/main/c3/platform/metadata/ImplLanguage.Runtime/py-data.json "https://github.com/c3-e/c3server/blob/release/platform/platform/src/main/c3/platform/metadata/ImplLanguage.Runtime/py-data.json") ( consequently the same for `py-ml` , `py-data-science` because they both have `py-data` as parent in their json files ([here](https://github.com/c3-e/c3server/blob/release/platform/platform/src/main/c3/platform/metadata/ImplLanguage.Runtime/py-ml.json "https://github.com/c3-e/c3server/blob/release/platform/platform/src/main/c3/platform/metadata/ImplLanguage.Runtime/py-ml.json") and [here](https://github.com/c3-e/c3server/blob/release/platform/platform/src/main/c3/platform/metadata/ImplLanguage.Runtime/py-data-science.json "https://github.com/c3-e/c3server/blob/release/platform/platform/src/main/c3/platform/metadata/ImplLanguage.Runtime/py-data-science.json")). The official version supported by `c3.Data` is `1.3.4`. Is there any way for you to make the pandas version consistent with `c3.Data`?
