All, 

To foster the collaborative environment that is critical to our continued success, as previously communicated, the C3 AI Flex Workday program will no longer be available after December 31, 2022.

Beginning January 1, 2023, you are expected to work from the office on a full-time basis, 5 days a week.

Thank you,

	Who made the decision?

	

	What does it mean: 'critical to our continued success'?
