Source vs. Canonical

Canonical<c> mixes Source

If you have multiple Source types, you can provide a transform from each of them to the Canonical.



Data Ingestion is a subset of Data Integration.

Information on ingesting data https://learnc3.litmos.com/course/3636295/module/11341265/Scorm?LPId=0&review=True. 

Useful Ingestion Commands: 

InalidationQueue.countAll

Job frequency is 100,000 records per job

 c3MonitorQueues
 c3StopMonitoringQueues

SourceFile.fetch
	//SourceFile contain data about the copying of files
	// used to trigger and onitor data integration records

	compare to "File" c3 type which do not save metadata
	the import api call imports file into platform

//to get status of processing individual records is 

SourceFile.get("{name of uploaded record}").sourceStatus 

"Seed" folder data is an alternative to importing raw data by using the "import" File member.

in the training Source/Canonical are used interchangably even though they differ slighty. 

To upload data to Canonical/Source --> include data in seed folder seed (s/2 10 MB limit) or can send data bby import api call
