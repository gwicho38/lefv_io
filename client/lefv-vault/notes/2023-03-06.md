## 📝 Notes

06/03/2023:03:75

batch --> reintroduced

app reworked around batch notion

visualization hangs off of batch as opposed to scenario --> only trajectories that are relevant to batch

create batches?

one tab …

mvp --> simplify page

one filter panel

one kinematic visualization

one ir chart for ir metrics

one 3d visualizer

april v1 release --> date? early april

data model changes --> integrated

ui -- mostly reflects matching concept

grids --> updated --> visualization -->

for a given scenario --> only show batches with ir and ref trajectories ref that scenario

load data and run to get a reasonable model -->

	ohe context?

dropping roles and users -->

TODO: Follow up user roles and permissions
