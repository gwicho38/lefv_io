{@aaron} 
AWS high side. There is a question --> should a lab in this customer build out the ML. Should it be a community. 

Who is more able to handle scaling. 

Request: Doing continuous batching with LLM. 

There was a meeting this morning. 

Compelling narrative and people are excited. 

Make sure that we're pulling from the latest. 

Relevance score should include a date header. 

Time --> sub 1 second for GPT model retriever.


{@remington} meeting notes

- Some answers are incorrect when aggregation across documents is required – will provide spec & description
- Recent documents are not prioritized as most relevant – will provide spec & description
- Agents’ logic should be explainable – will provide spec & description
- What is the formula/logic for the relevance score – should provide in next week’s briefing
- Can LLM/OSM handle relative geospatial calculations? For example, “what is the distance between the southernmost point in Spain and the northernmost point of Morocco?"
- For each question style, what is the delta between human and LLM-based labels? Justification: they want us to figure out a way to automatically score large sets of questions.
- What is the status of tabular data payloads?

[12:12] Ravi Sharma

For agents' logic should be more explainable - are they looking for more information than the step by step example we showed? Eg a distance calculation is necessary, these are the locations, these are the distances, etc

For handling relative geospatial calculations, currently we cannot. For getting the right locations, we will require much more customized prompt engineering. And I don't think OSM supports that sort of relative location query even if we can extract it. See below for an example:

### UPDATES

> how does agent and tools integrate with the base app. 

> for engineering --> data integration only needs to look at a subset of the data. 

> 

### TODO

{@unstructured_query} Investigate documents that have different dates and versions -- making sure that you pull the latest. 

	=> review what product has on this. 
	=> {@remington} and {@aaron} to send clarification

 > check on how unstructured agent defined old. 
 
 > since agents and tools are working together, need to show architecture of agent and tools. 

	>> define what we need for agent framework
	>> note relationships
