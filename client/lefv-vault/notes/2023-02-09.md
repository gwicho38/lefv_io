#dsu 

Temperate at the bottom --> log or linear representation for intensity metrics 

if temperature --> linear scale would be ok

would the change over time vs point be more useful as a presentational point for ir representations?

Stacked RefTrajs vs IR Generated against same trajectory. 

export model meta information as features?

input parameters 

#todo 

- add doc ticket --> ChangeLogQueue.d()
