## Jared Investing Strategory

I have:

  

**Vanguard:**

Taxable Brokerage (paycheck after expenses goes here)

Roth IRA (main, due to unassisted Backdoor Roth IRA)

Taxable IRA (empty used to facilitate Backdoor Roth IRA)

  

**Fidelity:**

401k (former employer)

HSA (rollover from former employer)

  

**Schwab**

Personal Checking (main)

Taxable Brokerage -- converted from USAA I had in college and accepts new C3 options & RSUs

401k (C3)

Equity Awards (C3)

Roth IRA

  

  

  

Thought about consolidating Vanguard brokerage into Schwab, but no point unless I want a mortgage. Trying to just have fewer accounts across places to keep track off.

All the major companies are pretty equivalent brokerage-wise now. All of em are 0-fee w/ free trades (For shares/ETFs, not mutual funds). I started vanguard back in the day when places were $5 a trade and Vanguard did their Vanguard ETFs for free.

  

Now it's a moot point, I just keep my direct deposit to it out of momentum/splitting to two institutions for (likely irrelevant) risk mitigation

Both are solid platforms
