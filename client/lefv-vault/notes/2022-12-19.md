## 📝 Notes

19/12/2022:12:73

GTD Schedule (just reviewed with Dave, can discuss at the meeting @ 10:30)

1/5 Pre-UAT PRR review. (Need to coordinate Maneesh / Zach on PRR testing)

1/09 UAT begins (CVTC with training on app) - 2.5 days for users to check out the software, Thursday (1/12) review of findings to discuss fixes before production release. 

My preference is to potentially de-scope items to hit the UAT schedule.  Go-Live may push depending on how many findings they need.
