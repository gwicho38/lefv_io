# Description

Optimization changes to get the visualization page to populate data.

This PR will need to be updated per some additional changes I need to make, but for the sake of getting eyes on the work ASAP, I've put it up.

# Performance Note

It will be important to test in production-like environment. ~~Dev environments are presumed slower and performance should improve.~~[1](https://github.com/c3-e/c3fed-mda/pull/1429#user-content-fn-1-740b20c6af1b5dcbc1118a2259bdc889)

For components like the heatmap (feature in the video). There is noticeable lag time between the request returning and the component rendering on screen. This suggest overhead related to the actual rendering components and/or dev environment.

# Known Bugs

There will be a bug ticket that needs to be filed in order to sync the Intensity graph `xAxisPointer` with the Heatmap `xAxisPointer`. This functionality previously worked, but currently does not.

# Video

# Future Development

There are various optimization points that could be fruitful -to discuss with team whether the C/B and time allows:

1.  Vectorization of heatmap computations inside of `IRTrajectoryGenerationResults`.
2.  File-based caching using a priority heap.
3.  Client side db store with IndexDB API.
4.  Serialization using more performant Python libraries (would require update to ActionRuntimes).
5. Have generateMockModelRuns take a list of IDs and return a list of modelRuns. Separate out the fetch and upsert respectively from the "functional core" into an "imperative shell"


```
