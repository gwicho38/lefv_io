## 📝 Notes

# C3 CLI Install

```
mkdir -p ~/cli && curl http://BA:BA@localhost:8080/static/nodejs-apps/cli/cli.tar.gz | tar xvz -C ~/cli
cd ~/cli
./c3 install
echo "alias c3='~/cli/c3'" >> ~/.bashrc`
c3 prov help -u BA:BA
```

# Install C3 UI CLI Packaged with Server Version

> Note: I do this to avoid a cli/server version mismatch

## Authenticate to VanityURL

`c3 key -e http://{vanityUrl}:8080 -u BA:BA`

## Install c3 ui

`c3 ui install -e http://{vanityUrl}:8080 -u BA:BA`

# Create UI Working Directory

> Note: This can be run whenever there is instability or caching errors are suspected

```
function create-ui-working-dir() {

  echo "Clearing npm cache -0_0"
  npm cache clean --force

  echo "Removing ui working directories for $1"
  sudo rm -R ~/tmp/C3_UI/$1/output;
  sudo rm -R ~/tmp/C3_UI/$1/working;
  sudo rm -R ~/tmp/C3_UI/$1/log;

  echo "Creating working directories for $1"
  mkdir -p ~/tmp/C3_UI/$1/output;
  mkdir -p ~/tmp/C3_UI/$1/working;
  mkdir -p ~/tmp/C3_UI/$1/log;
  
  echo "Created the following structure for $1"
  cd ~/tmp/C3_UI/$1/;
  tree;
}
```

# Bundling

> Note: creates working directory, log directory, and ui bundle directory

>
>

>> The ui bundle directory has mostly the same effect as generating offline bundles with UIBundler

c3 ui -W ~/tmp/C3_UI/{packageName}/working/ --log-dir ~/tmp/C3_UI/{packageName}/log -e http://{vanityUrl}:8080 -t {tenant}:{tag} -u BA:BA --out-dir ~/tmp/C3_UI/{packageName}/output/'

# Zipping Package For Export

> Note: Values for anything in curly braces need to be swapped with hard code string or bash param

```
function zip-package () {

  dateCustom="`date +%F_%T_`";
  c3 prov zip -u BA:BA -D -t {tenant}:{tag} --output ~/c3/builds/{repoName}/${dateCustom}{packageName}.zip

}

c3 prov zip -u BA:BA -D -t mdaPTS:dev --output 
```
