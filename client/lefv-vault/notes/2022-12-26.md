Please provide the amortization schedule for the $30,000 promissory note.

	

2.  Attached please find the documentation I have for the bathroom repairs.  There were two payments that aligned with the date of this documentation through the business account, 09/21/21 $5,000 and 9/22/2022 $2,000.  We just want to make sure this is the full amount of the bathroom repairs.
3.  Also, just so we have the correct figure these were all the expenses we have for the flood damage, please let me know if this is everything or if we are missing something.  If we are missing something just confirm it was made through your personal account and please provide the amounts:

1.  09/21/2021, Jeremy Wilson, $5,000 (Bathroom repairs) – through the business
2.  09/22/2021, Jeremy Wilson, $2,000 (Bathroom repairs) – through the business
3.  09/08/2021, Foundation Systems, $12,000 – through the business
4.  09/09/2021, check #97 (Lancaster post flood), $1,500 – through the business
5.  06/27/2021, Michigan Fire Restoration, $10,734.05 - through personal
6.  09/08/2021, in conjunction with the Foundation System payment above in letter ‘a’ there was another $2,000 paid with a check, I’m assuming this was paid through personal please confirm.

Based on the list shown on #3 the total cost because of the flood was $33,234.05 (The A/C and other minor repairs from prior to this is not included).  Please confirm if this seems accurate.
