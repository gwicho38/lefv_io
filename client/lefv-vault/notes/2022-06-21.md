THAAD Missile Overview:

	The last two frames of seeker data for THAAD missile describe trajectory.

Hit Point Assessment: 

	Where did it hit? The exact point that it hit the target.  

Classification:

	What did it hit?

Data:

	Images
	We don't know what the data looks like. 
	Focal point image (probably)
	Unlikely to have hitpoint labels. 

Inflection/Tension: 

	Will the prediction be made in the missile or will the prediction be made pre launch.

	 Jeff Schneider -- too much variance in the data then it'd be much harder to predice. 

	Paladino: It may not be that you get --- it could be raw focal point information. 

Details:

	There is simulated data. 

Follow Up: 

	There is another group that may be looking at this for another missile type.
