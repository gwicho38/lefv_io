Armen Hagopian Luis Fernandez de la Vara Not sure if this is on your radar or not, but presumably we will need a V8 version of [this package](https://github.com/c3-e/c3fed/tree/develop/commonFed/uiSecurityFixes "https://github.com/c3-e/c3fed/tree/develop/commonfed/uisecurityfixes") to ensure we pass sonarqube scans. The GenAI core team asked me to scan their app and I see that the Iframe component in V8 fails security scan.
